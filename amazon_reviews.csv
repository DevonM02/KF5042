234,-1.0,2018,Product had false key.  Fake Microsoft phone number appeared after I hit the activate button.  pc was hacked.' fake caller took remote control.  I unhooked internet when confidential data was flashing on screen.  Watch out.
235,1.0,2018,the codes worked fine.  Im not really a fan of having to buy this program every year though
236,1.0,2018,This product was good i loved that i was able to give some codes out to couple of friends that needed this product
237,1.0,2018,It is just a must have for your computer what is not to like.
238,1.0,2018,Having access on more than one device helps.
239,1.0,2018,wouldn't go with anything else
240,1.0,2018,"Quick, convenient way to get a subscription for Office 365. Easy and prompt handling."
241,1.0,2018,"This was a really great deal. Doesn't include Publisher though, which was a bummer."
242,1.0,2018,worked as it was supposed to do
243,1.0,2018,The students benefited from this software
244,1.0,2018,great price; love office 365 and I can share with my family. Works great with my Surface Pro so I can write on my word documents.
245,1.0,2018,Not a fan of Microsofts pricing policy but if you have multiple users in family this Amazon purchase is the best value and software is still the best in the business.
246,1.0,2018,Great price for Microsoft Office 365! I searched the internet over because I was buying this for a nonprofit and it fits the bill.
247,1.0,2018,just continued on my subscription.
248,1.0,2018,Glad for the coverage.
249,1.0,2018,Not much change in basics but you can go way far if you like.
250,-1.0,2018,"I am forced to use it because of work... Too expensive, same bugs that have been in Office for 15 years.  Microsoft is the too big and too arrogant!"
251,0.0,2018,Good
252,1.0,2018,Excellent price for a lot of value. The installation is very easy. Activation and upgrades are automatic. Besides that you get 5 licenses and 5 terabytes for storage. I think to renew for years to come.
253,1.0,2018,"Lots of hiccups in the installation process over two PCs.  Some because of me and some because of the product.  Online chat was very helpful with correcting issues.  I've been using Microsoft since the 90s and have always been pleased.  However, this whole subscription thing is a hit to the pocketbook"
254,1.0,2018,Arrived on time. Great product. Price could be cheaper.
255,-1.0,2018,Over priced. Found it cheeper after I bought it.
256,1.0,2018,"This product works well on windows 10, however I have not been abel to get it to work on windows 7."
257,-1.0,2018,duplicate order received product is fine
258,1.0,2018,Get access to programs I like without having to pay major money to upgrade to the next level.  Works great so far!
259,1.0,2018,It's working fine.
260,1.0,2018,See headline.
261,1.0,2018,Cheaper than going through Microsoft.
262,1.0,2018,Especially like the ability to email link to someone to share for other users.
263,-1.0,2018,Have had one problem after another down loading office.  Took all night and could not use instructions that came with.
264,1.0,2018,easy to install
265,1.0,2018,"You got 5 licenses and 1 terabyte per license for cloud storage. Just this 1T is worth when compared with icloud and Google drive. Again, 1T per user up to 5 users. Office is perfect and MS is adding a lot of things on it."
266,1.0,2018,Good deal for multi-computer family.
267,-1.0,2018,"it didn't work, gave me  number to call, and was a scam because they wanted $400 to fix whatever they say was wrong to why it wouldn't load.  I have never had such problems.  This was disappointing and a waste of my money.  Still can't use it."
268,-1.0,2018,"This stripped down version gives you some of the features but not all.  Outlook has features not available, and Excel will not run any sheets that have complex macros built in.  Spend the little extra and get the full blown installed versions from the 2016 Home edition."
269,1.0,2018,great
270,1.0,2018,Excellent product and service
271,-1.0,2018,"Everything is slower. Excel is hands down the worst. The amount of auto-this auto-that that is enabled by default is incredible. It's like the UI designer thinks we're all retards. Powerpoint is the only thing that is much nicer. Everything else, don't bother."
272,1.0,2018,"works well
the price for a Mac User is ridiculously high--most do not need anything but word and power point
the changes in those programs are largely irrelevant for the routine user but the old version of Word won-t run on the new Mac operating system
thus a high price for really nothing useful to the user
i am writing this in hope that Microsoft will stop gauging the routine user for the software"
273,1.0,2018,Works great.
274,0.0,2018,"I've been using Microsoft Office in all its different versions since it first appeared.  I knocked two stars off because, among other things, Outlook 2016 doesn't have a unified Inbox.  Each email address has it's own .pst.  So, if you have multiple email accounts, you'll either need to look through multiple inboxes for your mail, or write a rule to direct all your accounts into a new .pst you'll create.  I did this, but that's not without its problems, too.  Unbelievable.  I like POP email because it resides on my local machine, and can be easily searched.  It's obvious Microsoft, in this version, wants you to use IMAP, which does no more than show you a picture of what's already in your web based email accounts.  The argument is that IMAP allows you to check email from multiple devices, but with POP you can still leave email on the server by simply checking a box (Gmail, etc).  And, IMAP makes searching for a key word among all your emails impossible.  I like the 5 machine licenses, but would rather have Outlook 2007 than this.  The forums are filled with complaints about Outlook 2016, and thus far, Microsoft is unresponsive."
275,0.0,2018,Use it daily with mixed results!
276,1.0,2018,just what we needed.
277,0.0,2018,"MS is now becoming an annual fee software provider.  Soon their operating systems, i.e., Windows 10, will be an annual purchase or go dead after your a day late in paying the annual fee."
278,0.0,2018,"I'm frustrated with subscription based software. Microsoft tends to lag while the program checks to the Internet for the stupidest things. I do enjoy Powerpoint and Word the best, but am considering switching to OpenOffice next year."
279,-1.0,2018,"Update to the horror. Now one of my clients is unhappy because my email throws an unverified alert. I am not using an exchange server and must edit a line of text for SPF on my domain server. I have exhausted all ideas on the web - no luck

Tried to install this on three machines. Install worked on #1 and #2, but Outlook refuses to connect to email on machine 2. Just hangs up. My third, primary, machine was a total disaster. It would not install, so I got remote ""help"" from Microsoft. The first tech screwed it up by editing multiple registries, and renaming folders. After that, it would no longer even return to Office 2010 from a valid DVD. A second tech finally undid enough to get Office 365 working and quickly left me. I then discovered QuickBooks WOULD NO LONGER work thanks to Microsoft. I further discovered they changed my default browser, and left three new programs installed on my machine that I do not want. Further, 36 new ""important updates"" started appearing with windows updater. QuickBooks absolutely would not reinstall or repair from the product DVD. Thank heavens for Revo Uninstaller. It cleaned up QuickBooks remnants enough for me to get it going again. It also removed the three leftover junk programs. Total lost billable time is over eight hours."
1237,0.0,2018,This is a great Bible. I've had one for years that finally fell apart with use so I ordered this one to replace it.  The problem is that the paper is thinner and the words on the reverse side of the paper show through enough to make it difficult to read in many places.
2487,-1.0,2018,can not get it loaded.
2488,-1.0,2018,"Did not integrate well with existing microsoft office documents, had to uninstall."
2489,1.0,2018,"This was the perfect fit for me. My Sample ""word"" program expired and I didn't want to download $100 plus for the current word product.  I only write a few letters during the year and it was just to much money. This gave me the disk so I can install it to any other computer I might have in the future."
2490,-1.0,2018,"The soft ware was almost impossible to install on my computer. I did not like it at all and would have returned it if it had been more expensive, was not worth the time"
5189,1.0,2018,I thought this to be very inexpensive for all that we got.  Great for the you boys for their computer center in our home school.
5190,1.0,2018,"This was the first dash cam I ever bought, and I like it quite a lot. It has all the features you expect of a dash cam and pretty good picture quality. The colors seem to be a bit too dark, but that may be due to the bright sky most days. I only recently had to use it for a claim, but I had no trouble retrieving the necessary video."
5191,1.0,2018,I had a crash earlier this year and the camera saved a lot of discussions later. I was on a three lane one way street on left lane and the guy in middle lane last minute decided to turn left on an intersection. He stated it was my fault as he said I made a late lane change and I ran a red light. Camera cleared that issue as the super high quality of the recording clearly showed I was driving on the lane for quite a while and that there was still 15 sec left of green light. Beats dealing with witnesses that are not reliable.
5192,1.0,2018,"very good computer the intel Dual Core i3-2120 3.3GHz CPU, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 500GB HDD configuration is good enough for light use. The price is amazing"
5193,1.0,2018,"However, after the corn was harvested a few days later, the kids found the lost Syma . It had been run over by a corn picker and was outdoors for a couple days. Had a couple bent rotors, but still works!"
5194,1.0,2018,"I'm a total drone newbie. It's all there in the box.  The manual is the usual Chinese confusion, but everything is described and there are excellent videos on YouTube.  I highly recommend this product for beginners."
5195,1.0,2018,"This drone is great, camera is way better than expected. Extremely happy to have bought this drone.  Will fight winds nicely but is blown around as its so light. Great fun and price"
5196,1.0,2018,This is the second one ive bought from these guys . The product is fantastic value for money and works well.
5197,1.0,2018,"My first cctv in my home, was so easy to set up, now have a second camera and thinking of buying a third, all monitored via my phone using their app"
5198,1.0,2018,Do like the little camera. This app works fantasitc and does the job more than i can imagine. stil to say great camera for the price as it isso easy to set up with an andriod phone
5199,1.0,2018,I buy this ip camera so i can keep an eye on my 3 year old daughter. Its very easy to use just download app and follow instructions. Connect to your internet and the way you go. I like the way you can watch anytime on your phone by clicking the app. It has night vision can rotate with no noise and audio so i can talk to my daughter when she's playing up she thinks its great and talks to the camera. The quality is pretty good both day and night. Amazing little camera.
5200,1.0,2018,"I overall really like this dashcam, its sleek and stays out of the way, plus the excellent video quality. The first unit I had failed on me with a defective battery but rexing replaced it with a new unit after contacting them.."

5202,1.0,2018,"Great deal for the money, the camera quality is great. No regrets at all."
5203,1.0,2018,"I recently had a car accident and thankfully I have Dashboard Camera  and saved me a lot of headache and money. The accident seemed that I was at fault but after CHP review the footage, it showed that I wasn't to be blamed."

5207,1.0,2018,awesome fast
5208,1.0,2018,"Received in time. Plugged it in and it was automatically recognized by my Win laptop. As I use 2 Wi-Fi networks on my pc and stable internet is critical to me, I use both in-built Wi-Fi receiver module on my laptop and plugging in Wireless USB Adapter. Everything works nicely. Two networks simultaneously."
5209,1.0,2018,This solved a problem with my Wi-fi card which suddenly stopped working. Perfect solution and a lot cheaper. Worked fine and solved my problem. Easy to use and well made. So far a great product.
5210,1.0,2018,"It covers screen barely on sides. Falls bit short on top n bottom too. It may look like large size guy wearing medium size pants. Display is amazingly sharp, stunning and beautiful. It catches No fingerprints. It doesn't create a glare either. Works perfectly in outdoor too. Giving 5 stars only due to size issue. I wish it would be bit larger on all edges. I haven't dropped my phone since applying this screen protector so can't speak for that part. Will see how it goes."
5211,1.0,2018,This adapter works was as described. Very easy to Install and works perfectly. Great price for this item. Great connectivity. Would recommend.
5212,0.0,2018,The WiFi Wireless USB Adapter did not work out of the box with Windows 7. I had to find the model number Ralink RT 5370 and find a driver online. The antenna can only point downward or sideways when plugged into the USB port in the back of my computer.
5213,1.0,2018,"This thing works a treat. Works very well. Very good signal, router downstairs while PC upstairs. Fast download speed. Very happy....."

Easy to set up, figure out,been looking for something for my Motorcycle,someone side swiped me and I didn't get any info on them,so I've been looking. This Works nice ,clarity is wonderful ,even in the night. Of course you can't just leave it attached while away, but it's not a problem taking it off when I walk away. What I really like and what's most important is the rear camera."
30936,-1.0,2018,All the reviews are not for the product listed. Amazon needs to straighten this mess out.
30937,-1.0,2018,"So far, I am not impressed. It did arrive quickly, but it does not work for us. I followed the instructions to a ""T"" several times on several devices and it would not connect. I started skeptical because there is no product on Amazon that has 300 reviews and every one is 5 stars. This is literally the 2nd 1-star review (and I think the other person was wise for not purchasing).  I've grown even more skeptical and plan on returning this product unless someone from Opticover is willing to help out."
30938,-1.0,2018,"I looked at purchasing this Router.  However, one has to wonder where these ratings are coming from since some of the reviews, along with the questions folks have asked about the product, do not seem to have anything to do with this product. What's-up Amazon."
30941,1.0,2018,Got this computer today and I got to say I love the small foot print with the tower. So far it seems to work as good as all the rest of the Dell's we have had... I know that this come on in February of 2018 (very new) and I sure hope it is going to be a great computer.
30942,1.0,2018,working well
37688,-1.0,2018,Very expensive.
37689,1.0,2018,Great Deal
41367,1.0,2018,Easy to use I liked that I could edit it when needed
46272,1.0,2018,"did not come in box, but works fine."
46273,-1.0,2018,Ordered this after the earlier version Works in Windows 10 went Kaplooey. This went in easily. Then when I tried to use it I found that it doesn't have Grammar and Spelling. The supposedly worse version did. I looked up fixes on the internet and all information seems to be it can't be fixed. It also doesn't have Help. Debating whether to return it and get Office..Will Office even substitute? Not technical so maybe there is something I don't know about this.
51197,1.0,2018,"Im not sn IT person, but the set up was easy and didn't take very long. All wifi items connected fast after pass word inserted. I would use this company again."
51198,1.0,2018,Very good ..
51199,1.0,2018,This router came highly recommended for my current budget and needs. It was super easy to set up and has far outperformed the router it replaced. Very happy I customer! Excellent product. Good quality. Very useful. Thanks
51200,-1.0,2018,DO NOT BUY. This is a scam product and all of these 5 star reviews are fake. Returning immediately.
51201,1.0,2018,This router works great. The speed it faster and the Ultra HD looks sharper.  The setup instructions are a bit hard to understand.
51202,-1.0,2018,"1. Contrary to the description, it's not high-speed. Only Fast Ethernet.
2. The distance is no longer than 30 feet.
Cheap."
51203,-1.0,2018,"The review that has 5 stars
I really wonder that is real
It doesn't stay connected the whole time
I would not recommend the product"
51204,1.0,2018,perfect device. the only thing that would Make this better? people that actually wait for it to be released and test it themselves before Reviewing it.
68702,1.0,2018,Great stable release of Mac OS X. It's nice to have a physical DVD to do reinstalls from. I use this disk frequently. Fast shipping.
68703,1.0,2018,As describe.
68704,0.0,2018,"No complaints, outdated now."
68705,1.0,2018,Worked perfectly to update an old macbook pro
68706,-1.0,2018,This item is faulty. I followed the steps as instructed by the Apple Store Genius Bar person and this disc was useless. Amazon won't let me return it. Typical...
68707,-1.0,2018,Wen I buy the cd  it was scratch  wen I got
80808,-1.0,2018,"Misleading: Claims instruction is in Spanish, but does not have any keyboard exercises for Spanish characters. Refund request was denied.
Hassle: Download did not work first 2 times; finally company sent me an updated version, that did work. Why did they send me an outdated version in the first place?
Main Menu Instructions: As others have said, confusing from the beginning.
Program: Cute, but not intuitive. May be OK for children who like games.
Solution: Bought Typesy, which offers a more direct method of instruction, and is more appropriate for adults. Like it for its clarity, and intuitive set up of typing exercises."
81729,1.0,2018,"Very easy to set up and the copy is comparable to the original tape video.  The S-Video connection does seem to be sharper that the RCA cable, so spent the extra to get the S-Video cable.  It is so much easier than other options that I have used, including trying to use the VHS to DVD copy machine.  The software is very basic and a bit of disappointment for a Roxio product.  The Windows version has serval editing functions and Mac version just records, though you can split the track after the fact.  I guess, because you can import directing into iMovie, they think that editing tools are not necessary.  No mute button, and you only have a couple of options for setting the length of the recording.  It would be very helpful if you could specify the exact length of the recording, otherwise you have to pay attention to the video or set a timer.  All in all, it does what it says and I will be spending my weekend eliminating the pile of video tapes in my closet.  Bought from Best Buy since they do price matching with products sold and shipped by Amazon.  I haven't had any problems with dependability or quality, but I have only been using it for a day."
81730,1.0,2018,"Product is as expected, it did take an update when I plugged it in and then it started working. Before that it was not wanting to work. Love the fact that I can capture the movies now and use them in iMovie!"
81731,1.0,2018,"Ive tried several different types of software to get my old VHS home videos onto my Mac and none have worked, until now.  This is easy to use, easy to setup and gives great results.  Highly recommended."
83148,1.0,2018,This is the best HDR software program I have tried.  Easy to use and amaziing results!
83149,0.0,2018,Program is good for doing HDR photography...but for a $100.00!  Way to much for the limitations of this program

86547,-1.0,2018,terrible.
86548,1.0,2018,I don't recall how well it did critically/financially....but anything with Will Ferrell is an automatic classic in my book. :)
86549,-1.0,2018,Terrible and waste of money

86557,1.0,2018,"Even though this wasn't a block buster, it is still a fun movie to watch! Danny McBride is hilarious!"
86558,-1.0,2018,Really made me question Will Ferrell's choices in life for participating in this movie.
86559,-1.0,2018,I should've known better.  It's awful.
86560,1.0,2018,Just watch this for Chaka. Do it.
86561,1.0,2018,Will Ferrell can be a bit hit-and-miss in my book with some of his movies. But this one brings me laughter every time that I see it. Great goofy story line with implausible funny situations make this an instant classic. We love watching this again and again. Highly recommended.
86562,-1.0,2018,Such a dumb movie!!!
86563,0.0,2018,"Not Will Ferrell's best film. However, it is still pretty funny."
86564,1.0,2018,Funny funny funny
86565,1.0,2018,I love silly humor and this movie is full of it. I know a lot of people that love this movie like I do. Interesting that Matt Lauer will probably be noticed by future generations from his role in this lol.
86566,1.0,2018,Great movie
86567,0.0,2018,"Had it's good moments, however, a little too corny."
86568,1.0,2018,"I'm iffy on Will Ferrell and was sure I would hate this movie, but my man made me watch it and I laughed my butt off. Now we quote it to each other all the time."
86569,1.0,2018,"3 minutes into the movie and matt lauer is calling will ferrel irresponsible . . . . yeah ok matt, tell that to your career since about a month ago."
86570,0.0,2018,"It's a dumb movie, but the kids like it."
86571,-1.0,2018,"The disc was scratched to hell because of the locking tabs being broken an the disc sliding around,
Its not difficult to tell if the disc is locked in and if not they should be considered damaged product.
I bought extra cases for this reason but i shouldn't have to have done so.  Good movie... Bad quality control."
86572,-1.0,2018,I couldn't see it
86573,0.0,2018,Funny movie
86574,1.0,2018,quick shipping great movie
86575,1.0,2018,"Gave it five stars b/c my 7-year old loved it. Me, not so much"
86576,-1.0,2018,"Waste of money. This was awful. If it hadn't been cheap, I would have been mad at myself for buying it."
86577,1.0,2018,Silly but funny. One of my favorite dvd for vacation. Can be watch with both widescreen or old tv and the picture still come out nice.
86578,1.0,2018,If you love will ferrel comedy and Darby Mcbride youll love this movie.  Makes me laugh every time I watch it.

86582,1.0,2018,got for collection
86583,1.0,2018,Weird but fun
86584,1.0,2018,Great movie - wore my first DVD so had to get it again.
86585,-1.0,2018,Item was not new had been unwrapped was a Christmas gift had to give as it was an explain what happened..... not cool
90957,1.0,2018,my daughter really uses it and learning very well
90958,1.0,2018,My kids (9 and 12) love this!
90959,1.0,2018,I cant believe I haven't heard of this software product before! It is fantastic! Graphics and sound are good too. It uses the premise of finding a treasure on an island. You have to earn clues and reach milestones along your route by typing well (both speed and accuracy). Wish I had this when I was a kid.
90960,-1.0,2018,"Sorry, this program wasn't able to grab and keep my kids attention.  Other programs I've seen do much better."
90961,1.0,2018,"I think its great, the kids hate it though, I'm hoping they will keep trying. They said they don't need to know how to type this way..."
90962,1.0,2018,Wonderful program for my 8 year old.  He really enjoys using it to learn to type.  Cute and fun story line as well as games after each lesson.  Works perfect with Windows 10.1
90963,1.0,2018,"So fun, kids love it"
90964,-1.0,2018,"I bought the PC version because of no internet. Misleading product information, as it does require the internet to register and use. Amazon doesn't accept open software returned items, so I can't even send it back to get my money back, but you  don't know that you need the internet until you have already opened the product."
105862,1.0,2018,I love everything about this program. They really put a lot of thought into this. Entering information is straight forward and easy right down to adding photos.
105863,1.0,2018,Haven't used it yet but it looks like what I was used to with Microsoft Office.
105864,1.0,2018,"I needed a program that would print labels. The word processing program installed on my computer just would not print labels. I found this EZ Home & Office software on-line. I am so happy that I did. The program will do more then just print labels and I love the way you can sort the labels. It's easy to use and the support for the program is wonderful. The only tiny problem I have with it is that it won't print envelopes. This has only happened once or twice with other users so it's something peculiar to my printer. I would not let this stop me from purchasing this program again. It is a wonderful program and I am very happy that I have it. Elwood Software is great to work with and gives excellent support. If you are looking for label printing software, give this one a try. I don't think you will regret it."
105865,-1.0,2018,I got the product on time but I do not like the  product.
105866,1.0,2018,Great tool for a small business. I wish they would do upgrades as well.
105868,1.0,2018,"EZ Home & Office was exactly what I was looking for.  I purchased a new computer and did not realize that I had to take out a subscription for Microsoft Office, just to be able to type/print address labels...and that would be the only feature of Microsoft Office I would use.  I searched and found EZ Home & Office and ordered it, installed it, which took about 5 seconds and I have been thrilled with it...it is EXACTLY what I wanted. I would suggest that anyone who does not want a subscription to Microsoft Office purchase this program...I am 100% satisfied and happy with it."
105869,1.0,2018,"Excellent, just what I was looking for.  In early 1990s I used AddressMate, a 16-bit program for Windows 3.1 that came on a diskette (which I still have), but eventually MS Windows later versions stopped supporting 16-bit programs.  Now years later I found this and it is even better and more flexible and usable than my old, old favorite.  Highly recommended.  Valuable to any home office or small business office.  And a great reasonable price.  Use it every day (and I am now 80)."
105870,1.0,2018,Great
105871,-1.0,2018,I was disappointed. I found this clumsy and difficult to use. It was very plain and seemed archaic for the price. I returned it.
105872,1.0,2018,great product for keeping track of people without have to write and re-write changes.  so easy to use
105873,0.0,2018,"I think that anyone purchasing this program should be aware that it is only supported by its author Jeff Elwood. When you receive your disk it includes a hand signed letter from him stating that he wrote the program and uses it daily. When I had an issue early on a Saturday morning with the right border not printing when I printed the Birthday/Anniversary calendar I sent an email to the address provided in the letter. I didn't receive a reply until Tuesday afternoon. The reply apologized for the delay explaining that his daughter was married on Sunday. It also suggested that my problem was likely a printer driver issue not a program problem. I replied that my printer was an older model running in compatibility mode on a newer computer and I asked if there wasn't a way to modify the calendar template so it would print out properly. I thought that since he wrote the program it should be a simple matter for him to make a slight change to the calendar template file and email me a copy. No such luck. Instead, two days later, I received the terse reply of sorry but no."
105874,1.0,2018,I find it easy to use plus it has many features I like.  I updated my address book and printed it for my desk address book and was pleased the way it turned out.
105875,1.0,2018,Well designed address book software. Makes Christmas cards easier.
105876,1.0,2018,Very easy to make labels and to modify them afterwards.
105878,1.0,2018,Havent used the software yet.  Info included seems clear enough
105879,1.0,2018,"Easy to use and can be used for a wide range of things. Address book, birthdays/anniversary reminder, labels, envelopes, You can use one database for Home and the other for Business. This program is great."
105880,1.0,2018,"I have only started using it. Thus far, I have loaded some addresses into the files, but I really like the way it is organized, and laid out. The reports available and the ability to print labels, etc., are just great.  I can't wait to get it finished and try out the various things, such as the address book, and mail merge functions to send out Christmas cards, etc., etc."
108930,1.0,2018,Highly recommend. came on time and easy to download protection to computers.
108931,-1.0,2018,"Do not waste your money.  Worthless customer service.  Product is not very good, told me they don't worry about little viruses only big ones.  You can't catch the little ones, how am I going to trust you with the big ones?  Malwarebytes or avast, both free, are far better than this.  You don't want this, trust me."
108932,-1.0,2018,"Never again, it messed up our computer, deleted drivers that were needed and messed up settings then went rogue and hacked stuff up. What a waste of money and then my time to restore/fix my computer. Buyer beware."
108933,1.0,2018,I bought this product a long time ago...Its kind of have problems in the service dept. But the program seems intuitive and changing over the year. I am beginning to trust this product. more and more. I have been using various firewall and virus scanners forever. Most or crap...and I have had infections while running several programs. And this seems to be the first one that appear to get better over the year.
108934,1.0,2018,"If you have not tried PC M you are missing a very complete utility program, it's fast and very user friendly. I have been using PC M for more then a year and at this point would not even consider changing. And I am very that it is a USA product."
108936,-1.0,2018,"I have used pc matic for the past 2-3 years ( not purchased on amazon ) and never had any issues. Since downloading the product from amazon my pc freezes & has slowed down, Hopefully going to get refund from amazon & get renewal directly from pc matic"
108937,1.0,2018,Loads easy and works well.
108938,1.0,2018,"the real set it and forget it security solftware, I have been using it for four years and all five devices have run smoothly without trouble all this time.well pleased."
108939,1.0,2018,Product worked really well and I feel protected from Malware which really messes up your computer. It also eliminated most of those annoying pop-up ads. Easy to install and scan.
108940,1.0,2018,"I have been using this on 2 machines for over a year and it is awesome. It has cleaned up my laptop, eliminated unwanted programs, and just kept me running smartly"
108941,1.0,2018,"Best PC Anti-virus, and performance software on the market. I have been using this product for four years and have not had any issues."
108942,1.0,2018,"Recently joined, my computer works great"
108943,1.0,2018,Like the update notifications.
108944,1.0,2018,Love it. It actually does speed up an older computer
108945,1.0,2018,Great product and protects and cleans my computers monthly. Wouldnt switch again. I have used other products but switched 2 years ago.
108946,-1.0,2018,Returned it. Very confusing. I went back to Norton.
108947,-1.0,2018,needs to be delieted
108948,1.0,2018,"We've had no issues with our computer since getting PC Matic.  It's been quick, no freeze ups.  So far so good."
108949,1.0,2018,"worth every minute, and when purchased, worth every penny."
108950,1.0,2018,I cant say anything bad about this product. Ive had PC Matic for about three years and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a reasonable priced American product that does what it says.
108951,1.0,2018,Since I've had pcmatic I have not had one single virus or any problems as I did with Norton.
108952,1.0,2018,"Bought around the first part of the year and
I have nothing but happiness, So Far, So Good. You see I have an old desktop and after loading it down-what a big difference it made in speed and safety. ""Now they claimed a lot of things and they delivered big time in my experience. Don't take my word-do the research and check for yourself, it made me a believer and it will do the same for you if given the chance, price is far and offers a-little more then the others."
108953,1.0,2018,"Great software, easy to install, easy to use, would recomend"
108954,1.0,2018,Great tool to keep your computer running fast!!!
108955,1.0,2018,This is the best software for your computer.  I have used others in the past and they don't work as well as this one!
108956,-1.0,2018,"This product has been installed on my computer, sine then my computer has slowed  and the keyboard is nt as responsive. I cant type fast enough and som letters or strokes are missed"
108957,-1.0,2018,I was unable to ever download device no matter how hard I tried.  Just please send me a cd!  This is ridiculous.  What a scam.
108958,1.0,2018,"Switched to PC Matic a year ago and have rested easy that my computer was protected by the best. It not only protects but tunes up my computer automatically, what a relief. Thank you PC Matic."
108959,1.0,2018,great help in keeping new computer clean!
108960,-1.0,2018,i cant download
108961,-1.0,2018,"Below is a copy of e-mail submitted to PC Matic based upon product performance.  The company criticizes Microsoft for the problems, however, it appears to me that there is more to it.  It took many hours to bring computers up to operational status.  No computer ever had an issue until this program was loaded.
e-mail to company: Down loaded PC Matic from Amazon. Key = MVYEE-157V3R.  Installed on 3 Windows 10 Pro computers. 2 on same network and 1 on different network.  After 1st scan and reboot one computer would not reboot.  The other 2 lost USB keyboard and mouse support.  Windows repair disc corrected one unit, however, on 2 units repair was not possible and reinstall was required. I do not think this is totally a Windows 10 problem. I have not reinstalled PC Matic.  Thank you.  Dr. George M"
108962,1.0,2018,"At first when I saw the commercials I didn't believe it, but when I started looking on amazon for a new anti-virus as my webroot subscription was running out. I saw PC Matic I read the reviews and they were all good. I figured hey I'll give it a shot. And I'm amazed at the difference it has made. I have installed on both laptops in my household and also installed it on my grandmothers old desktop. And we are all happy with it. Will definitely renew next year."
108963,-1.0,2018,do not like this software made my computer do funny things removed it from all my computers. am going to call pcmatic to see if I can get my money back.
108964,1.0,2018,Ive tried every security program out there. They were pricey and non-effective. Ive been very pleased with PC Matic. I get daily updates and my computer is running much more efficiently. Great product!
108965,1.0,2018,"Everyone should own this product! No more worries about malware, bugs, and slowed performance. Great price for protection that's second to none! Made & developed in the USA..another reason to buy."
108966,1.0,2018,"I've been using PC Matic for three years and it has been very easy to set up, update, and operate. Options are clearly explained, without jargon and other confusing information. I would recommend this to anyone that is tired of the difficult to use other antivirus and performance utilities.  I've used three of the other ""major and popular"" utilities and PC Matic is the best. This one is written for real people. Combine that with the five-computer usage from one subscription, this can' be beat."
108967,1.0,2018,Worked as advertised.  Inexpensive - - MUCH less than Norton.  I'm renewing after having been totally satisfied after my first full year.
108968,1.0,2018,"Didnt renew pcmatic a few months ago and my pc began to get slow and sluggish.  Eventually it was unbearable.  I recently purchased pcmatic again and almost imediately the performance got better.  Not sure how it works, only that it does"
108969,1.0,2018,Great activity and interface/
108970,1.0,2018,"I have had this protection for about a year and it has served me well.  Dec 20, 207 hackers called me pretending to be Microsoft tech. informing me that my computer was being attacked by malware and that my protection was not going to cover that.  Foolishly in the beginning I allowed them to access my computer to help me out, but became suspicious when they wanted to charge me for protection software.  I quickly close everything out and disconnected them from my computer.  I ran PC Matic afterwards and a few more time to protect my computer.  I checked my scan report and noticed that there were several attempts by miscrosoft dummy to access my system.  These attempts continued all the way through January.  I just renewed my subscription for lifetime with the updated version and I am super happy."
108971,1.0,2018,"The best product of it kind out there, have used for 5 years and have never had any bugs or viruses of any kind on this computer or any of the others that PC Matic was installed on.  A really great price and a really good buy if you want your computer protected from all the malware and viruses that are out there.  The support is also wonderful.  If you want to feel safe using your  computer be sure and buy PC Matic."
108972,1.0,2018,PC Matic is the best antivirus for the price. I feel secure having this on my computer!!
108973,1.0,2018,One of the best programs around. Does what they say it does.
108974,1.0,2018,Since I subscribed have not had to worry about security of PC. Support has been pretty good but wish that they would acknowledge that email response times are BETTER than advertised. Also wish that subscription included MAC.
108975,1.0,2018,We put it on two newer computers and they run faster.  It was very easy to install and very simple to use.
108976,1.0,2018,"So far it's been great, I bought a brand new laptop and downloaded PC Matic right away."
108977,1.0,2018,PC Matic has been a life saver for me keeping my computer clean of virus and malware. My parents now use PC Matic on all their computers. BEST VIRUS PROTECTION YOU CAN BUY. Blows McAfee away
108978,-1.0,2018,"not a happy camper, will not write all my concern, they would not print ir."
108979,1.0,2018,I really like pc matic.
108980,-1.0,2018,ON the 3rd hour of trying to download to my pc.  Good luck getting custormer service.  It sends you to a junky voicemail where you can leave a message and maybe somewhere in the universe somebody is listening.  I've had better luck with Norton/Kaspersky...even Macafee.  PC matic looks to be headed straight to the bin for me.  If you get hung up on downloading kiss your buns goodbye because there is no help.  I'd have better luck with protection by just placing a sharp knife on my laptop.  So disappointed.
108981,-1.0,2018,Downloaded but wouldn't run . Just messed up everything can't even open my emails! waste of my money! Know what you are doing before you buy something like this.
108982,0.0,2018,"I've got my scan set to run daily, but it won't do it. I have to run all scans manually, unlike my last program."
108983,1.0,2018,Solved many annoying problems instantly. Wonder why I waited so long!!
108984,1.0,2018,"Don't understand how it works but it really saved my computer from a Malware infestation. I gave up on Norton and the Windows security that came on the computer. Windows did not seem able to get rid of the malware, but PCMatic did. Awesome results."
108985,1.0,2018,"We have used a very well known security software system on our computers for 5 years. We decided to give PC Matic a try. We were shocked at the amount of junk that was removed on our first scan. The previous system was obviously not doing a good job. PC Matic is obviously doing a great job. The computers are running faster,  and every scan removes something. We have been very pleased with our purchase."
108986,-1.0,2018,Will not run at all. New laptop. will not work. Be safe do not buy.
108987,-1.0,2018,How many words in different languages  can I say CRAP. THEY DIDNT HAVE THE NECESSARY UPGRADE KEY FROM MICROSOFT  SO WHEN MICROSOFT DID AN UPGRADE AND DIDNT SEE THE PROPER KEY PC CRAPOMATIC SAYS SOME HOW IT CORUPTED THE BASE FILES OF MY DESKTOP. NOW THE ONLY WAY TO FIX IT IS TAKE MY WINDOWS BACK TO THE BEGINING SAVE ALL MY FILES RE INSTALL WINDOWS TEN REINSTALL ALL MY APPS REINSTALL PC CRAPOMATIC  AND HOPE IT WORKS. DONT BUY THIS CRAP
108988,1.0,2018,Used many brands of Security Software over the years but this one seems by far the most complete and least resource hog. Went to a couple of know buggy sites to test and it was 100 percent effective. Super Shield feature works well without being obtrusive.
108989,-1.0,2018,"It doesn't come with an individual scheduler for an individual computer. It says I have to reinstall it to get the individual scheduler, probably for an extra fee. It comes with a master scheduler that scans all computers once a month, which cannot be changed, except for the time and starting date. When I went to the website to find out how to reinstall it, it was no help. When I called the customer service, there was a recording that started with asking if you want a refund. I think that says something about the product. However, I was two days too late for a refund. I will continue using Malwarebytes Premium and Windows Defender. I have never had a problem with scheduling daily scans, and I have never had malware, ransomware, or a virus with them."
108990,1.0,2018,I truly only trust PC Matic as the only virus protector id use
108991,1.0,2018,Works great just singed up for another year.
108992,1.0,2018,"Works better than I expected. Definitely a great product. It really does protect my computer well.  I have had several computer programs for registry fixes, cleaning up, defraging, virus detection, etc.  This product is by far the best in 35 years of computer experience I have ever had.  I am glad that I purchased it."
108993,-1.0,2018,"This product SUCKS!!!!! I downloaded from amazon and it doesn't work, you can't get anyone on the phone to help. I have had better luck with the antivirus packages these guys slam.  Made in America yet leave you high and dry.  Dont waste your money"
108994,1.0,2018,"My previous virus protection left me with a massive memory leak, slowing my laptop and using my data allotment from my provider. Since installing PC Matic, the leak has stopped, speed has increased, I do online business with confidence."
108995,-1.0,2018,I cant stand PC matic they have no phone support I asked them to call me and no call. I want my money back!!!
108996,1.0,2018,PC Matic is easy to install and user friendly.  We use it for all our computers and have had zero problems with viruses on any of them!
108997,1.0,2018,This will protect your computer and stored information. It will also clean and update the security settings as required. You will be amazed how much junk it will remove.
108998,-1.0,2018,can not install
108999,1.0,2018,"PC Pitstop starts immediately upon logging onto the web, therefore intercepting any threat before it has an opportunity to infect the system. It runs seamlessly in the background without affecting your work, and remains there until it's needed, or you start any of it's applications. My 10 year old Windows 7, Dell PC has never performed better. The Super Shield feature provides a level of confidence that was not provided by a previously installed, well known cyber threat monitoring software service. PC Pitstop protects as advertised."
109000,1.0,2018,"It's easy to use,  good to go so far."
109001,1.0,2018,So far so good! I have tried different software to protect my computers and I have not been satisfied with the results. PCMatic is more robust and seems to get ahead of potential problems. I like the reports it generates and the ability to receive reports for other computers so I can keep track of the security of all of the computers in my house. Download and installation was simple and protection started immediately. A good American made product!
109002,1.0,2018,Stopped virus. Had many unwanted pop ups.
109003,-1.0,2018,Doesn't work don't waste your money!
109004,1.0,2018,"PC Matic does a better job of keeping your PC safe and clean versus the other security programs I used in the past,"
109005,1.0,2018,Easy to install and is the best product my laptop has ever had. My computer is faster and the programs run faster and smother. I feel safe now when surfing the internet. I have tried a lot of different programs that seem to always tell you they are working but with PC Matic you know it is working.
109006,-1.0,2018,Not very user friendly.  My PC crashed. I ended up having to reload everything. I didn't install it a second time.
109007,1.0,2018,Very easy to use and has improved my pc performance
109008,1.0,2018,Excellent product.
109009,-1.0,2018,"I am very disappointed.  The install on 1st computer was successful, 2nd computer not successful.  I installed and uninstalled many (4-6) times and still had issues so I emailed technical support.  Unacceptable customer service. Ok, I am not very (inside the computer) savvy... impaired may be a better definition of my skills.  I thought technical support was created for individuals such as myself.  There are several tickets out because no one finishes a single ticket. Instead when a new tech comes in they create a new ticket and send me the same first response email, so I am back to the beginning. Frustrating and infuriating.
I send reviews to Amazon, Home Depot, and several others... this is my first truly negative review."
109010,1.0,2018,"I installed it not knowing it can be downloaded to four other separate computers, which right off the back was convenient. installed it on the others and completely made everything run and operate smooth. 10/10"

114192,-1.0,2018,was not what I expected.  Returned to sender.
114193,0.0,2018,"This was my second Printshop, and I liked it much less than the first.  There was far too much selling and not enough of the wonderful sense of sharing an otherwise project book for all ages.  I found the short videos aimed at teaching how to do aspects of their craft were rushed and in many ways so simplified as to be insulting.  I spent time enjoying my first Print Shop, but this time I felt somewhere between pressured to buy and disappointed that so many of the ""lessons"" were shallow and rushed.  I will use this to make calendars, and maybe other projects, but as an 80 year old retired teacher, I felt that many of the  lessons  couldn't meet anyone's needs, being both superficial and a sort of awkward patronizing.  The things I wanted to ask some questions about never came up, probably because so much time had to be spent selling.  I really don't want to recommend this product. There is quality there, but it left me with ruffled feathers."
118147,1.0,2018,Great
118148,1.0,2018,I've used Paperport for 11 years and wouldn't go without it. Makes file management a piece of cake.
118149,0.0,2018,Product works OK.  Support after 90 days is virtually useless.  The software started crashing on startup and there is no technical chat help and phone call support costs $19.95.  Their knowledge base is useless.
118150,1.0,2018,"Installed this on a laptop running Windows 10. It works fine for document management, but the user interface is very basic and looks like something out of the 90s. Paperport's website is down, so it's not clear if the company is still supporting this software."
118465,-1.0,2018,Used to be a great program but has not been updated in quite a few years and doesn't function with the latest versions of Windows 10.  Truly a big disappointment.  Have to part with more dollars as I search and must buy a suitable replacement
118466,1.0,2018,"I had old standard paperport version 12 and needed new version to work with windows 10. I installed this on desktop and on a laptop and both times it installed with no issues and has been working good so far, no crashes. I was worried after many reviews were not good but i looked and found nothing that compares to the old versions i had used and liked a lot. So i took a chance and all good so far. I have more features now than i had on standard versions. Works well with epson adf scanner."
118467,-1.0,2018,This software was affecting my operational system on my lap top. I do not recommend it.
118468,-1.0,2018,"My Paperport 11 came with my Dell printer many years ago. I learned how to use it. I loved it. I depended on it to do my regular work.

When I bought new laptop with window 10. I had no choice but updating Paperport 11 to Paperport 14 professional so it can support window 10. After it, my nightmare started.

Paperport 11 was very easy to use. It had all the function I needed for my regular work. And it did the work I wanted it to do. Paperport 14 professional seems to have all the same function but they don't function well. And it may not complete the job I needed. Paperport 14 created so much trouble. A simple one minute job could take me one hour to finish. It is very frustrating.

For example, if I want to copy typed text from one page to other pages, the font will change by itself to so tiny that I couldn't see them. And I cant change the font back to be as the original as how I created.

Some time, I saved the document after typing some text. The typed texted may be all disappeared.

Some time, the resolution of each page changed itself. Within one file, few pages are bigger and few pages are smaller. They don't look professional at all.

Im at the point to give up Paperport. Can someone recommend me another software that can replace Paperport 11?"
118469,-1.0,2018,"I've been a long time user of PaperPort and other Nuance products, both in business before I retired and as a home user.  PaperPort has not kept up with updates and versions compatible with Windows 10.  I recently had a hard drive crash and had to reinstall Paperport 14 Pro.  First with the 14 version, then the 14.5 and then a patch.  My attached Visioneer Patriot 430 scanner worked ok, but it took forever to get my network HP Officejet 8600 Plus to work.  Their published scanner support is miserable.  The interface hasn't changed in years, and it's time for a newer look.  Don't get me wrong, I like the way it looks, it just needs to have a fresher look.  Many times it just locks up and I have to reboot to get it working again.  Nuance, if you are reading this, put some resources on getting this product upgraded to a new, fresh, version 15.  I've worked with you at the Fortune 500 company business level and I know you have other priorities, but, as in my case, it was the personal versions of your products that prompted me to recommend them at a corporate level.  If I had to rate just version 14.5, I'd probably give it one star, but based on my history, I'm being somewhat generous with two stars.

UPDATE: 1-8-2018 Well Paperport 14.5 crashed my computer again.  The problem for me seems to be using a network printer, HP Officejet 8600.  It locked everything up and it would not reboot, so my PC is in the shop again.  It did seem to be working with I used a Visioneer Patriot 430 scanner, just not the network printer/scanner.  I assume it is probably a driver issue, and Paperport does not seem to support that many scanners."

Don't know if this is true but it was suggested to me that if you already had this on your computer when you upgraded to windows 10 that may be the reason it still works. But if this is the first time installing it on windows 10 it will not work. I read the different reviews before I purchased it, some said it would work on 10 and some said it wouldn't,  but unfortunately it didn't work for me."

125297,1.0,2018,So far it's okay. Haven't  had checked it out completely.
125298,1.0,2018,"If you are new to Printmaster, you will find there is a learning curve. And some outright quirks. That being said, the price on this is right, and it is very powerful. Although Printmaster is clearly targeted at home users, it is quite possible to turn out professional looking projects if you have the skills. This version is the most modern one which has full (as far as I know) compatibility with the older Printmaster project file formats. So, if you have lots of saved projects from a previous version, and are using windows 10 now, this is the version you want."
125299,-1.0,2018,I bought it thinking that I was going to be able to do a lot of projects but it dosen't work!! sadly it was a waste of money !!

I finally wrote Borderbund and they wrote me back saying the program does not work in Windows 10. Apparently, none of the PrintMasters will."
125302,1.0,2018,"I love the PrintMaster 18.1.  I've used print shop for many years, then it wouldn't work on my computer.

134365,1.0,2018,so far only used once. worked ok no problems
134366,-1.0,2018,"It doesn't work. I am extremely proficient with computers, I have an advanced W10 machine and I have a lot of movies to transfer. Out of the box installation doesn't work and the cost of this system makes it too cheap to even worry about. Save your money and avoid Roxio products."

134384,-1.0,2018,"Steve B wrote on Aug 17 2016 a poor review and rather than rewriting it I'll just say I agree 100%.  I'll add that I had to turn off the computer's go-to-sleep mode, which I expected but it's not mentioned in the instructions.  Also, after a copying to DVD, successful, I turned off the VCR and the program hung up my computer.  While I was was recording another time I moved the program's window to the side monitor and the program hung up.  Another time after 80% of the VHS tape had been copied to the DVD, about 2.65 GB, the program decided to 'Finalize' the disk."
134385,1.0,2018,"This is a very, very easy application to use and it installed very easy.  Personally, I'm only using it to copy Mini-DV video tapes to CD for safe keeping. For that purpose, you simply click on that function from two huge icons and then determine what drive you want to record to. Then you click on a Record button. There are some features such as automatic stop that are nice so you don't have to sit there and wait for your original tape to finish (you would need to know roughly how long it plays for though otherwise you could cut your recording short).  The only bad thing I saw in the resulting recordings is that the Video quality is not as good as the digital Mini-DV tapes that were used to create them. The resolution is much worse with a lot of grain in the playback. The original recordings have no grainy appearance when they were played on the camcorder. There is also a variable amount of delay in the audio when comparing the audio being heard from the computer while recording and the actions (lips) seen in the video monitor, however, the resulting audio in the CD's when played back later on is in perfect sync with the video. It's only during the recording process that they are slightly out of sync.."

134399,-1.0,2018,"Sounded easy..it was anything but.  Despite meeting all requirements and following all instructions could not get product work.

134412,1.0,2018,Worked great did exactly what I expected it to do. Don't get it of you expect to have DVD quality because face it you are putting vhs onto a DVD you're gonna get vhs quality but its better than trying to deal with a vcr or finding one for that matter
134413,-1.0,2018,"It won't transfer some movies no matter what we do.... we have 15 vhs we tried to convert. One actually transferred to dvd, the others were left blank. Very, VERY disappointed. One plus was that the system was simple and took a little learning but was easy to use overall."

134417,1.0,2018,"This works great for the price, but be very careful when you start recording, I suggest playing around with a few minutes of video first after you read the instructions. If you start to edit a video and then back out or select ""start a new project"" in the menu in order to work around editing limitations, you may lose what you recorded... frustrating, but this only happened to me once.

This has a pretty easy set up process, easy to use and lots of options to upload/downloading videos, even after you import them to your computer, you can theoretically get them onto a DVD (haven't tried it yet).

I would also recommend using a VCR with tracking capability if you are transferring very old tapes to digital, this can help avoid the ""No Video Signal"" message from periodically showing up while recording.

This also came with sound editor software on the same download disk, I have not used it yet, but that seemed like a cool bonus. Overall I would recommend this, aside from that annoying interface issue mentioned above and the fact that it doesn't warn or confirm whether or not you want to do something you might not have wanted to. Don't spend $80 on that stupid fancy system C-Net wants you to, just get this and you'll do fine."
134418,-1.0,2018,"Did not work at all.  Was not given my refund.  Instead after paying to ship it back because it was worthless, was left with a ""RESTOCKING FEE"" for the full amount of $40.

Please save your hard earned time and money and stay away from this product!"
134419,1.0,2018,"All of my videos are now digitized on my computer and not soon enough. I had one problem with the unit. When it is hooked up via S-Video cable, which should present a clearer picture from the unit to the PC every few minutes it would stop recording and finish recording the video from the VCR. I have no idea why this is. I ditched the S-Video and hooked it up with the composite video and it worked perfectly. The software is just basic software. If you are looking to edit the videos purchasing a good video editing program is recommended. Overall Those are the only complaints I have. Other than that everything worked great."
134420,1.0,2018,"Works great, easy to use!"
134421,1.0,2018,"Software was really easy to use. It doesnt have a lot of editing tools or anything but it got the job done.
Compared to how much money places want to convert vhs, etc over to dvd/digital this thing saved me a ton."
134422,1.0,2018,"This technology was extremely easy to use and made the process of me converting all of my cassettes (mini-dv and vhs-c tapes) to digital.
It had a few quirks on the homepage (like changing the audio track to 2 to hear the sound) because I thought I had used it incorrectly or that it broke when I wasn't hearing anything.
Each 1.5 hour tape was did take up about 6gb of space though, so if you are looking to do this, I would get a large hard drive to save it all.
This technology enabled us to get rid of clunky tapes that took up space. The sunk cost was that you do have to press record and wait 1.5 hours for each tape, but it is a sunk cost compared to the large benefit you get of having all of your old tapes converted to digital.

Thank you so much for this, without it, I would most likely have had to get them converted by a company, which costs $20+ per tape!"
134423,1.0,2018,Great product
134425,-1.0,2018,"Although the product information on the amazon site indicates compatibility with Windows 10, it doesn't load into my Windows 10 machine. It asks for a ""Roxio Cine Player"" disk and only one disk came with the product and it's in the computers DVD player. The product information material that came with the product does not mention Windows 10 at all. Very Unhappy at this point."

134432,-1.0,2018,"I've had a horrible time dealing with this product and Corel customer support. It wouldn't install on my computer and once I finally managed to get it installed ( after having to replace the product key) it still says it's missing components and won't run. Customer support takes days to respond between emails and is constantly sending me to someone else for ""additional support"" which takes more time. I will definitely think twice before ever purchasing a roxio product ever again."
134433,1.0,2018,"Installed in minutes on my Windows 10 PC.  Recommend you go to Roxio support page and download the software update for Windows 10.  My application worked before I did this, but still recommend you do the update."
134434,-1.0,2018,"I installed on my pc, and so far it won't work.  Keeps saying it stopped working, so I would not recommend wasting your money on this junky product"
134435,-1.0,2018,"I purchased this product to convert stacks of VHS tapes recorded a gazillion years ago of parties, performances, graduations, and other important family events. (Yes, Im older than dirt!) I already have a dedicated DVD recorder and it records well, but it only creates VOB files, its ancient (Like me), and therefore limited in useful features. My hope was that the Roxio converter would make it easier to create MP4 files with no loss of video quality. Unfortunately that did not happen. Here are my complaints.

Strike one: It still requires a DVD to record onto and will not allow you to record straight to your hard drive.

Strike two: Yes, there appears to be a converter feature with the recorder program, but it requires the source to be either MPG or MPEG formats. VOB is out of the question.

Strike three and most important: The recorded video had wavy or slanted distortion near the top of the image. I believe it is called Jitter and was very annoying. I found another cable to connect my VCR to the Roxio converter adapter but it made absolutely no difference. This was a deal breaker.

In my book, three strikes and Youre outta here! By the way, instead of returning this bugger Ill keep it to convert gazillions of audio cassettes sometime. Yes, I said I was old! One more thing: the free conversion program HandBrake allows me to convert the VOB files my DVD recorder creates into MP4 or MKV formats easily. Perfect."
134436,-1.0,2018,"I installed the Easy VHS to DVD3 Plus program onto my computer running Windows 8.1 Pro and later needed to install onto another computer due to replacing my old computer. Therein lies the problem, no can do, and only allowed one install on Key Code. Corel my in the end give me a new Key Code??? I called customer service at 877-582-6735 - a number in India. Talked with Francis (service Rep), turns out he is a sales person and not a tech. Told me to send an Email explaining my problem and someone would contact me via Email. As of today 01/15/2018 after approx. 1 and 1/2 weeks, I am still playing Email Leap Frog with Francis. This has now become a game for me. I may in the future publish the Emails? I replied in the last Email ""still waiting"". Stay away from Corel products, there is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE HELP, just smoke & mirrors in my opinion. At age 75, I have time on my hands to play Email leap frog. I have since learned there are better products out there. Best buy in Daphne Alabama has since pulled this product. Try the Ubuntu iOS and Openoffice.com to replace Windows and Microsoft Office 365. Works fine for me. It is all free. YouTube is your friend

134437,1.0,2018,very simple works great love it
134438,-1.0,2018,"DO NOT BUY THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.  Their customer service will not help on the phone, it's only email.  I couldn't even get it installed.  They said they were having issues with servers connecting to register.  They would not refund because it was not bought directly from them.  After weeks of trying just gave up.  Terrible company and product....you've been warned.  I needed to do this for holiday project so I saw some negative reviews but figured I'm techie and could make it work.  The product is junk...buy another brand,"
134439,1.0,2018,"Arrived quickly, was intuitive, and did the job.  I have now copied dozens of old VHS tapes to a external hard drive on my laptop with zero problems.  Does the job - what more can I say."
134440,1.0,2018,"Oh! This is an excellent product. I was so happy to get this, and was able to transfer some old VHS videos to DVD and best of all, it was very easy, even for an amateur like me. I recommend this item because not only does it work great, but the price was unbelievable."
134441,-1.0,2018,"The software is what Should make this easy. Well, it's trash You have Zero control over quality on import. VHS is interlaced. Now, many of you don't know what that means, and that's fine. But in order to import VHS to a digital format, the fields need to be encoded in a different way that normal. you can plainly see that the encoding isn't done with interlacing in mind. The output video looks incredibly bad.

I Was able to use OBS (high quality free software, but is complicated for your average user) to create a much higher quality import. Of course, then why would you buy the Roxio one? Well, I wanted to support a local store. That was a mistake. You can get the same hardware for about $20. The software here isn't worth Anything.

Save yourself. Don't buy this. Actually, don't buy Anything from Corel except maybe Painter. Everything else they make is half-baked. That's how I like cookies, not software. They also try and nickle and dime you too much. Just have one version of some software, and charge me that price. Don't try and charge me for different options."
134442,-1.0,2018,"This product 100% does not work with Windows 10!!  The software installs without any issues, but somehow the video signal can never be found.  My package arrived and and I returning it tomorrow.  This is a useless product with false claims, I am looking for something else that does work."
134443,-1.0,2018,Awful.
134444,1.0,2018,System worked perfectly
134445,-1.0,2018,This is the worst product I have ever bought. I purchased a few months ago and finally installed and tried to use it on New Years Day. It captures the vhs poor quality and doesnt recognize my dvd on my computer and I tried numerous ways. Their technical support is slow via email and really not helpful. Ive spent hours trying what they suggested and nothing works. It looks like I won't be able to get a refund either. I would not recommend buying!!
134446,1.0,2018,"Works well, time consuming but works well."
137166,1.0,2018,"The best book writing software ever! I am new to writing, so I may not be the best person to make that statement, but I can honestly tell you I love it! It has a tutorial built into the software that I highly recommend you go through before getting started. It is loaded with so many features that I am sure I have not taken full advantage of them all as of yet.

You can download as a PDF or as an ebook. Amazon has an app to assist in creating an ebook for the Kindle.

If you are even thinking about writing a novel, song, recipe, magazine, or blog, pay the 40 dollars!."
137167,-1.0,2018,Honestly I would return this if I could.  Its. Ot a bad program but its frustrating to use and the files are way to convoluted.  I just wanted a smile notepad like program with a few more options and i bought this and was left dissappointed with the way it saves your projects and all the different features really feel all the same to me and have no special uses.
137168,1.0,2018,"this is an amazing product! it has helped me so much in my book writing. Thank you, thank you!"
137169,-1.0,2018,the activation code does not work. Never have been able to use it.
137170,1.0,2018,"Extremely useful for outlining a novel and organizing your thoughts.

I was worried that Scrivener wouldn't preserve my formatting when I exported my file to Word, but I've had no problems. Things like automatic paragraph indents are transferred to the Word file.

The only downside is that it does take a while to get used to. But if you figured out how to use Word, this should be no harder.

I'd imagine it could be used for other writing work as well."
137171,1.0,2018,I love the way this helps organize writing and assists easy reference.
137172,-1.0,2018,"Had to connect amazon for help getting the code to work.

I would not by this product again."
137173,-1.0,2018,"Strange, slow and confusing."
137174,-1.0,2018,"Do not purchase this product as I've tried several days to activate and when you email tech support, they reply they are overwhelmed with issues and will not answer any questions for at least two days.  Extremely disappointed in this purchase!!!!!"
137175,1.0,2018,Best Damn Writing Software on the market! The secret is it's inexpensive.
137176,-1.0,2018,Unable to use. Asked for a product code. Did not have. I believe I have uninstalled this software. If not send me a key to access the use of same.
137178,1.0,2018,"I have adhd and have shit EVERYWHERE on my pc. I love this thing. Just a quick review to say that it is bad ass. I wish the text had the clarity like MS Word does, but no biggie."
137179,1.0,2018,"Wow, I could almost cry, this thing is so thorough.  It does things I didn't even know were possible.  Things I didn't even know I wanted until the tutorial showed me how to do it and I thought, ""That's really useful!""  I can see why writers recommend this program.  It's awesome.  Index card notes, different tabs for everything so jumping to where you want to be is a breeze, color coding and labeling for everything set up just the way you want it (however that is).  If you haven't done the ""full tutorial"" yet (vs. the quick start tutorial), I recommend you take the hour or two and find out all the things you're missing  out on that this program can do."
137181,1.0,2018,Fantastic for screenplays
137182,1.0,2018,"Great app.  Takes some time to learn how to use, but there are multiple books available to help!"
137183,1.0,2018,This software is incredible. Makes writing a novel beyond easy to organize. Connecting it to Dropbox makes it accessible from any computer.  So good.
137184,1.0,2018,"I originally gave this product a 1 star rating because I had difficulty loading this software onto my computer. I ended up uninstalling/reinstalling this product several times, partially because Amazon's directions weren't 100% clear. I opened tickets with Amazon and Scrivener. I have to say that Amazon's customer service was outstanding. An Amazon customer service rep called me on the night I opened the ticket, and they were able to guide me through the installation. I called Amazon back when the problems still persisted. They once again worked with me to resolve the problem.

I received an email from the folks at Scrivener. I was able to successfully install this product after exchanging several emails with the customer service rep.

I've been using Scrivener for several days now. I LOVE this product. I learned the basics from watching a short YouTube video, and then I was off and running. Scrivener is the perfect writing tool, and it's super easy to use. There are plenty of Youtube videos to teach you how to use this software.  I like Scrivener because it helps me to organize my research and my chapters. I can directly import my Word without needing to cut and paste the material. I also love that Scrivener will turn your documents into print-worth PDF files, mobi and epub files. I'm sure there's a lot more that I can do with this software. I'm still learning.

In summary, this software is worth the money. Amazon's and Scrivener customer service were very helpful for answering questions and solving installation issues. The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars was that it was a hassle to load it. It's worth it though. I highly recommend this project.  .

 I like it because it helps me to organize my research and my chapters. ."
137186,-1.0,2018,"I'm afraid I've made a big mistake. Although I write, I'm not that computer literate which may be the problem. I can't make heads nor tails of this. I went to the forums thinking I could ask questions. The forum is locked. I don't know who or what to turn to. Can't find a phone number. I know that I can't return this. If I could I would. Disappointed."
137187,1.0,2018,"This is the perfect writing software for authors!

there are honestly so many wonderful features, but the following are my favorites:

- I LOVE being able to keep all of my ideas and background stories in well-organized folders while also staying in the same project as my manuscript!

- When I fire up the program is brings me exactly where I exited.

- The Customization options are plentiful! You can change the icons, change the colors of the folders, change the colors of pretty much anything if you want to... it has all of the useful features of Word so the actual writing doesn't feel any worse.

- I can go into full screen distraction free mode which his helpful. It has a lot of customization! (screen shot provided - the bar at the bottom goes away when your mouse isn't on it)

- There are so many tools that I honestly haven't even delved into them all. There's a tagging/keywords system (for my uses I put all minor characters as keywords in the chapters they appear in so if I then want to find what chapters they appear in later on it's very easy), there's a way to put references right into your document (handy for term papers, college students), also internal references (I like to make a page for all my locations and then reference it in the chapter is appears in). It has a convenient spot for footnotes and comments. You can make project notes that appear no matter what page you look at, and also single page only notes. You can add pictures easily into the document/chapter itself OR as a reference picture (you can see what I'm talking about on the far right tool in my screenshot I posted - you can also change it into a notecard and write a synopsis).

- I LOVE the split screen capabilities! I'll provide a screenshot for how my windows look as I write. It's so nice to be able to write and also have a second window up for my notes.

- But one of the best features is the Snapshot function! It makes the editing phases really nice for me. What it does is saves the page exactly how it is at that moment, then you can make sweeping changes and snapshot that (I rename my snapshots for clarification) and go back and reread the original. This is handy to have all the versions of that chapter/scene that I've worked on.

- Template sheets! They make it so easy to plan out my novel. I set up a folder for blank templates and then when I want to make a new Character Sheet I can just go to Project > New From Template (select template) and then fill it out.

- When you move items to trash they are not permanently deleted. So if you aren't 100% sure you want to delete something, don't worry.

You have to understand that I used to only use Word, which was a jumbled mess of ideas. Now I can spread out and have everything extremely organized. It has changed my writing life forever!

Note: The compile feature makes it so you can easily filter out your notes and make your finished manuscript into any format you want. You can literally put every single novel related thing you could ever imagine you'd want or need into one easy project."

I am so disappointed I have given up.
137191,1.0,2018,Writing is very difficult. This makes it much easier
137192,1.0,2018,"I love it!  I have used a lot of different programs to use for writing novels and this is the one.  The only downside is that it's a little complicated to understand at first.  I found that the youtube videos by ""Black Wolf Editorial"" are very useful."
137193,1.0,2018,"Scrivener is to my knowledge the standard setter in writing software. Granted I am a a newbie, in the writing/publishing arena. So take  this review with a grain of salt. I had to put my project on hold for 3.weeks  while  learning  to drive Scrivener now I feel I can resume writing my book with complete confidence., it is intuitive, helps you stay organized, teaches the structure of writing. I love it!!!!"
137194,-1.0,2018,"Though I love Scrivener, I have to say that I have had a horrible experience with their customer service, hence I am giving this program 1 star. After downloading the software from their website, the license would not work. I contacted customer service who just provided me the same license number that did not work. I clicked on the knowledge base link on how to fix this since I got nothing useful from customer service, and the knowledge base stated that I should purchase the software from the Apple Store (I have a Mac), which I did. The software worked great, but I had to pay for the software again. Upon requesting a refund of the original fee, I was basically told I was a liar, and they have nothing in the knowledge base which would tell me to download the software from the Apple Store (as if I would just pay twice for the software out of the goodness of my heart). The customer service rep has been rude, unhelpful, and unprofessional. If I could give two reviews, the one for the program would get 5 stars. But the customer service is so horrid that it's a 1 star review.

BTW - I was told there is a 15% restocking fee (on a digital download) to get a refund. And no refund to date. Just more horrible customer service demanding that I prove the knowledge base information, which conveniently seems to have been deleted."

Use your word processor  to create templates and outlines which you can drag-rearrange any way you like. RTM. Any word processor does it. They all can do it. Apart from the corkboard, which functions as a writing storyboard and doesn't have a direct parallel, that's pretty much all Scrivener does. It's a file system on top of your general system. But. It takes time and discipline and you have to work out how to use your existing resources. Scrivener has done it for you. It's focused on writing. It can be a great motivator. It's so easy to just start a Scrivener project every time you get an idea, and then add to it or develop it when inspiration strikes. So, it's OK."
137200,-1.0,2018,"Well I've used this software for 3 years now, over 3 years actually.  The software itself is fantastic.  It really is.  The support sucks.  I've written for the second time today trying to get someone there to help me figure out why I can't install this on my new computer.  The site says my activation code is no good. I figured that meant you buy the version you buy and no upgrades, fine, stingy, but I'll live with it, only the links to download the older versions are bad and don't lead to the proper file formats at all.  So no help there either.

Now reading the reviews it looks like the site is just not working and no one's codes are being accepted from Amazon and no one is getting any support either.  So I guess I'm stuck writing on my old computer forever or until someone comes out with a decent comparable software.  the software itself is invaluable, truly, and I was ready to purchase it a second time, even though I think that's ridiculous, until I saw the reviews from the past week.

Maybe this company is just circling the drain.  It happens sometimes and the first public signs are usually problems with support and the website.  So I won't be rebuying this software today or ever."

Doesn't hurt. I can't really rate software yet but once I figure it out i'll do another update.

150114,1.0,2018,Allows me to continue working on my older spreadsheets and text documents without buying hundreds of dollars worth of new software. It functions very well in Windows 10.
150115,1.0,2018,Quick and easy better than Word.  I write a newsletter and keep calendars for my group.  I was using Word this is much better.

150121,1.0,2018,Downloaded to my desk top. Everything works fine so far. Can't believe its free.
150122,1.0,2018,I found that it's sub programs were a good alternative/supplement to my Microsoft programs and I could accomplish my needs.
150123,-1.0,2018,"don't know if Apache open office is on my computer or not. I have not been able to find it. I have looked for it the best I know how. When I tried to download it I didn't see anything to lead me through the process. If it just automatically downloaded then tell me where to find it, I wanted to put it o on my desktop. can you help me with this?"
150124,-1.0,2018,didnt work
150125,1.0,2018,Still using this two years later and its the competition's poor person solution. Works exactly the same but better and free.

150127,1.0,2018,It works great

150133,1.0,2018,I loved using this but I have a new computer and I wanted to install it on my new computer but I can't find it now. It was really easy to use.
150134,1.0,2018,It is just like it says in the information.
153001,1.0,2018,"I had this program on my Windows PC. It was a welcome alternative to the Windows equivalent and it was free!! Even though I tried and tried to use the software that came with my MacBook Pro to produce the documents I use to organize my life, I just could not use them with confidence! Open Office suite of programs are comparable to the Windows software and that makes it easy to adapt to the Mac. So far I only use the spreadsheet and word processing parts of the suite, but having the rest for presentations, etc. is nice to have as well. Thanks Amazon for making it an easy download. As usual, you came to my rescue."
153002,1.0,2018,Love it
153005,1.0,2018,Great product but beware of the update push there are none so don't update Apache its a scam
153006,-1.0,2018,Product didn't work on my Mac.
153007,1.0,2018,This is a pretty basic office tool.  If you want to type and print a document easily this will do it.
166923,1.0,2018,Had an old 2010 and it was time to replace. Good value for the money.
166924,1.0,2018,"Worked Perfectly!  Other reviews had me really nervous, but it went easy peasy :)  I was easily able to extend my existing subscription for another year.  Saved $$$ too!"
166925,1.0,2018,like it so far. need to explore and get to know all of its capabilities .
166927,-1.0,2018,FRAUD! This product expires in under 60 days!
166928,-1.0,2018,"I have wasted several hours trying to download and install this product. Each time I ended up with a screen that said Congratulations....Your Download Was Successful. Yeah? Then where in blue blazes is the !@#$%^& program. Spotlight couldn't find it, I can't find it in Finder....I've never encountered such frustration before....and this after an upgrade to my previous version of Office for Mac, 2011, corrupted the program so badly that it refuses to do anything but tell me how to report the problem to Apple."
166929,1.0,2018,Easy to install and works GREAT on my mac.
166930,-1.0,2018,"Very deceptive. Purchased a Microsoft RT surface tablet with Office preinstalled, AT FIRST I was impressed. So then purchased a surface book (1st gen) after, again office 365 preinstalled. Months went by and a (forced) update occurred. Thought nothing of it at first, until all my software / apps were removed. Although incredibly upset I carried on, reinstalled all the software but go figure the hardest program to reinstall was office 365. Although I have an account, when I try to reinstall the software, microsoft says I don't have a subscription to Office. So essentially, if you get 365 preinstalled you better go fishing through your system for the product key to write down, because otherwise Microsoft is gonna have you for the money...terribly unfortunate.
Minus points for you microsoft!!!"
166931,-1.0,2018,"i never was able to install this every single time i tried entering the product key to actually download it it would constantly say that the product key was not for my region, regardless of the accounts or region i used. even after contacting microsoft i was left with no answers and 80 dollars wasted.. I'm a service member so selecting products on a correct region has alway been difficult. I'd just like a refund on this product if even possible"
166932,-1.0,2018,"Worst thing I ever did due to compatibility issues with other software (specifically QuickBooks Pro Desktop).  Had to uninstall and then do a system roll back to get rid of all the changes.  I also now cannot return it as I purchased it through Amazon, not directly from Microsoft.  It would have been worth the extra $20 to purchase it directly so that I could get a refund for this horrible software.  I am instead now out $80 and have a subscription that is completely useless to me.  Likely will not ever purchase downloadable software through Amazon again."
166934,1.0,2018,We had troubles with the region of the code but Microsoft people assist us and it worked perfect
166935,1.0,2018,Super easy every year.  And save some money in the process.
166936,1.0,2018,"A very inexpensive way for your first purchase or renew your Office 365 subscription.  I renewed by copying the product code key from the download area, and then went to my Microsoft account and under Payment & Billing, under Payment Settings go to redeem a card or code and paste the new code there.  I uncheck the auto-renew option so I can always get a better deal and redeem another code next year.  You should get a reminder when your subscription expires."
166937,0.0,2018,"I have been using Office 365 Home version for the last couple years. When I bought a new laptop in December 2015 I wanted programs similar to those I used at work (ie, Word, Excel, and Outlook, primarily). I have been happy with the applications; however, there have been some recent changes, although somewhat insignificant, that I 'm not happy about. The issue concerns the various notification sounds that I've noted in Excel and Outlook, in particular. In Excel, I have found you can change the sounds under OPTIONS >EASE OF ACCESS from Modern to Classic. My software was set as Modern in which the sounds seem very electronic, much like those you might hear in a video game. I  thought Classic would have the softer tones that I was used to hearing in Excel, but the sounds in Classic are again very electronic with pings and riffs. I would appreciate Microsoft putting back the original sounds as a default setting. I know this may seem insignificant, but I really do not the new sounds. In general, however, I do really like the applications available in Office 365 Home"
166938,1.0,2018,Excellent
166940,1.0,2018,It is a complete system that works well.
166941,-1.0,2018,Cant remember my Microsoft password so I cant download it. Very frustrating!
166942,1.0,2018,"Unfortunately, for the consumer, Microsoft has changed it's business model on software, and I get that. I have used an Office product for decades and am absolutely confident in its reliability, so I will continue to lease it on an annual basis."
166943,1.0,2018,Works very well.
166944,-1.0,2018,"After hours of headache trying to download the software I boughkt with an iPad thinking I would use it, it turned out to be a waste of my time! Cant download it on my iPad. Because they tell me since I had paid for and downloaded the same software for my laptop! I can buy the software but cannot install on my iPad! Who would do that! I will cancel both sets of software!"
166945,-1.0,2018,My niece used this before I did and since she was the first user it registered her as the master account holder. Now I cannot install the program on the other 4 systems because I cannot access her account. Microsoft SUCKS. The help department was no help!
166946,1.0,2018,thanks
166947,-1.0,2018,"I have had it a month and have had nothing but problems with outlook loading, conversion of my old outlook data file. Right now I can't even get outlook to run on my laptop."
166948,1.0,2018,"I was looking for less expensive option, so i came across to this offer and found it as best option on price in the market. Bought it and immediately could install it easily. Overall satisfied on that fast service."
166949,1.0,2018,"I agree with some, that the installation wasn't problem free. For a novice it might be hard to follow. But once it's instlalled, everything works great. And I really like some of the new features in some of the apps.

I was working with Office Online; I didn't realize how much I use some of the features that are in the full version, as opposed to the online versions. I have always found having the office suite to be a real lifesaver, and I've found a lot of creative ways to use it. For me, it's worth the money."
166950,-1.0,2018,It doesn't work!
166951,-1.0,2018,What ever happened when you buy a program and it's yours for life? Not just 1 year

166962,1.0,2018,Simple to upload. No issues.
166963,1.0,2018,Convenient and easy to download
166964,-1.0,2018,"Where to start? Nothing works. Excel is a slow, unbelievable nightmare. Excel hangs when deleting a tab. It hangs when it pastes a large amount of data. PowerPoint is a complete joke. PowerPoint refuses to change the proofing language across all slides. You have to change the proofing language for each - individual - text - box. I repeat - each individual text box. The function simply doesn't work on the entire presentation. Excel is just the worst. It uses only one core on my MBPro 15"". It is SLOOOOOOOWWWWWW saving 26 Mb files. It just stops accepting input. It's about the same level of horrible performance on my piece of junk windoze PC at work. It's Microsoft - they are just horrible at everything they do. I use it because I have to, not because I enjoy being raped every time I try to get work done, but because I have no choice. It is a horror. I advise you to use Apple's iWork suite. Numbers is light years ahead of Excel in many things and for pretty much anyone who needs casual to moderate spreadsheet use, it's excellent and far more flexible than this junk called Excel."
166965,1.0,2018,Excellent
166966,1.0,2018,Straightforward download.  Needed to compose resumes and we were using templates via Word in minutes.
166967,-1.0,2018,"This is the worst software product I have ever encountered.  It's unable to tell when a person is registered, and locked me out soon after I purchased it, saying I hadn't purchased it.  When I finally went back to the store, they said, oh yes, that's just a glitch in the program.  Okay.  So I bought an Apple computer.  A year or so later, I decided to give Office 365 a second try.  I took the laptop I had purchased from the pc store back to the store and asked them to fix whatever was wrong so that the system would know that I had in fact purchased the software.  This signed me up for another couple years and spent a long time fixing the situation.  However, after a few days the machine kept telling me I had an expired version and that as of some date (actually a past date) it would toss me out.  So I took it back to the store and the techs tried again, and failed again.  So I've spent a few hundred dollars, and have wasted a few hundred dollars of my time, with no progress.  The most amazing part of it is the store techs can't tell whether or not they've solved a problem, and are unable to do so, for something very fundamental.  Good luck, customers."

166977,-1.0,2018,"It's hard to live without the programs, but PRAY that you don't need tech support. Even the most basic questions have been an absolute hassle. How can an organization so large have such poor tech support? The first thing that happens (as a U.S. user), is that you are routed to someone (God knows who) in another country. Often, I've been so frustrated at the wait time, I give up. Absolutely horrible. While Apple support isn't perfect, they get the job done - and quickly."
166978,1.0,2018,Great.  Very easy.
166979,-1.0,2018,"I hate this product so much. The ""365"" aspect of this product feels much more like a scam/inconvenience than a benefit. I am often mysteriously signed out of my account and then asked for my product key/password to sign back on. This didn't happen for the first 1-2 years that I had the product. But now I am routinely kicked off and have trouble signing back on, which effectively makes it impossible for me to use office products (other than as read only). I wonder if this is a (designed) glitch to try to get me to switch to a more recent version of this product."

166990,-1.0,2018,Microsoft is a horrible company.  I purchased this subscription to replace a 1 year subscription I had the prior year.  I have spent several hours on the phone with Microsoft Support who continues to threaten me everyday that I have not paid for my Office 365 subscription.  Amazon will not refund my $59.99 for this product and Microsoft will not allow me to use it.  Tell me how that is functional for anyone who just wants a stable software product?

173404,1.0,2018,I really like this approach to language learning.  The speakers speak clearly and model good pronunciation.  The program is easy to use and just plain fun.  Very motivating!
173405,1.0,2018,"Ouino is truly an amazing program!  It is so smooth, colorful, and many various ways to learn.  I have tried  many programs to learn Spanish, and  this is by far the best.  It is designed to encourage participation by inserting motivating symbols and positive complements.  It lets you repeat a lesson as much as you want and shows your progress in points and music!  Real voices say the words and you are able to speed up or slow down the speaking.  This program is fantastic!"
173406,1.0,2018,"This program is hands down the best product I have ever used. It teach grammar tenses, words and sentences you would use on a daily basis. I have tried all of the language programs and none ever compare to this one. Dont waste your money and other products, you won't be disappointed with this one. I have the Spanish, French and German program and soon to buy the Italian program. Really hope they come out with more down the line, will buy them for sure :)"

There will be free additions and updates to look forward to down the road, but there is plenty to do and learn until then."
173410,1.0,2018,"Great program! I am really enjoying learning Spanish now that I have begun using Ouino.

It lets you listen to some of them on the computer but you can't on the smartphones. That is a real downer.

175829,1.0,2018,"get prime with it and the voice remote, music everywhere and all the music you remember on the go."
175830,-1.0,2018,"The one star is for it actually playing music, that's it.

- the shuffle is awful, I get the same song 3 times in about 40 minutes having over 100 Songs in my playlist
- you can't quick exclude music from a playlist, you gotta skip or make a whole other playlist
- Amazon is STILL not offering a Playstation 4 app (give Spotify just the control over everything)
- you can't quick search something in your playlists/library without clicking the search bar, which is naturally put to ""my music"" instead of just generalize it , but instead make us click another however many times to adjust where we wanna search (my music, prime, OR store which is just plain asinine)
- the skip buttons in the app are pop up and incredibly small, why go for something like that? Keep it simple

I know I have more gripes with this app but I can't think of them right now. It's simply a really badly designed app. The shuffle is the biggest gripe I have with it. Why not do it like every other app on this planet? Shuffle the whole playlist in a random order and play every song ONCE until it reaches the ""end"". That's music app 1 o 1."

175837,0.0,2018,I basically have this so I can get my music from amazon.  The only real plus amazon has over the google music store is that when I download the music it includes all the album info and makes a folder for the artist and album.

175841,1.0,2018,Accessing my own music as well.
175842,-1.0,2018,"The app doesn't appear to allow me to upload any music from my older CDs.  I have purchased these, and it appears like I cannot reference/listen to them using the Amazon applications like Alexa. From the reviews, it looks like this used to be a feature.  This was expressly why I wanted this application.  Only solution appears to be to purchase a digital copy again from Amazon...not going to buy the music twice.  Would change rating if that feature worked, but unfortunately I have music that I purchased that I can't access."
175843,-1.0,2018,I guess I was just ignorant  I thought I could save some music for a game I wanted to play with friends.  It would not let me save to my computer and I could not find a way to end the free time.  When I finally figured it out I was charged for a new month.  I kept trying to end the subscription by looking on the returns page and was never given a return bar.  Then I finally found that I needed to do it on the music page.

175874,-1.0,2018,"Every time I purchase a song, I end up spending an hour plus on the phone with customer service to try to get my music to download to my device. I have done this on 2 different occassions. The last time I was told the problem was resolved.  I downloaded one more song, and same problem. I did not call customer service again, I simply give up on Amazon Music. It is frustrating."
175875,-1.0,2018,"I am running this on a recently built PC, with very capable specs, and Windows 10 Pro. This is the only application that has trouble of everything I have installed and use. Downloading purchased music is so laggy and taking so long, It's almost as if it is doing something it wasn't built to do, except it's doing one of the ONLY things it's meant to do. I might uninstall this heap before it even finishes the current task."

175879,-1.0,2018,"Is a great service but when I ordered a special edition album by Hillsong I did not receive the tracks that were supposed to come with it.
I specifically searched out that particular album because it had the extra acoustic tracks with it and I confirmed before purchasing that this was indeed a fact. I should have done a screen shot because after I purchased it and downloaded the album the tracks were not included. I contacted Amazon to see why they were not part of my download and was told that the extra tracks were a separate purchase. I complained that I painstakingly made sure they were included before purchasing and told them to look at my order. they still denied me and when I opened my order to do a screen shot as proof they had changed the product to no longer include the extra tracks...but I could purchase them for an extra cost.
Pathetic. I no longer plan to make music purchases through Amazon in the future unless it is a CD that can be mailed.
The Album was Amazing as Hillsong always is. I was able to download other music prior to this."

175892,-1.0,2018,"Not that awesome. The free Prime use is good enough to put a playlist together and have a reason to use the echo my kids gave to me as a gift.  Amazon wants to sell, so unlike my current service Music Match, Yahoo Music, Rhapsody,  and now called Napster (go figure) that I pay $99.00 a year for and get access to almost all if not all of any artist catalog, Amazon for $79.00 a year as a $99.00 per year Prime subscriber, $99.00 I think without Prime, Will give partial access to an artist catalog while requiring purchase of the more popular stuff.  An example of this is Boston's iconic first album BOSTON, with a Rhapsody subscription you can stream it, with an Amazon subscription you still have to buy it."
175893,1.0,2018,I really liked it - played my unusual taste in music!
175894,-1.0,2018,Drag and Drop doesn't work can't even add outside music
175895,1.0,2018,Amazon Music is great...
175896,1.0,2018,"I first installed this app on my PC then later installed it on my iPhone. To me, the app is the source of my self-debate about whether to renew Amazon Unlimited Music or not. Several cons I've experienced:
Two different times (in a year), I've lost all of my playlists. This now limits me in making playlists since I don't want to have to go back and redo the playlists from scratch so I went from 20+ to 5.
The app has a mind of its own. I tell it to repeat, it shuffles. I tell it to shuffle, it repeats. I tell it to repeat an entire playlist, it instead repeats the current song only. This isn't that frequent but it has the worst timing for becoming moody. Usually right when I'm going to bed and loading my sleep playlist.
Using it to stream playlists across wifi is hit or miss. On my PC, it does fine, can go for 8-10 hours straight without a problem. On my phone, I go to sleep with music playing and wake up 3-4 hours later to complete silence because something disconnected. You can fix this problem by downloading the playlist to your device but I don't want to have to do that with all my playlists.
It updates all the time. I would estimate once a week. Maybe it's just once every 10 days but either way it stops the music while updating, takes up to 10 minutes to update then you start closing your eyes hoping when you open them your playlists are still there.
The app's navigation can be a problem too. Looking for your settings? They're up there in your profile inside the player. You're like me, you had no idea you have a profile inside the player. The settings (preferences) are inside the profile which you can access by clicking your name at the top of the player. Is it that hard to put a little gear icon on the main screen? If you're like me you'll need the preferences/settings at least a few times. The defaults are set to launch a Windows notification telling you the name of every single song as it starts. If you work in MS Office, especially Excel, those notifications can completely block 2-3 boxes of your work. Why is this turned on as default? It seems to me that the logic says I saved the songs into my playlists so I most likely know the name of the songs.

That's a lot of complaints but this app is getting the ""graded on a curve"". Most other music apps do similar illogical actions. Once you get everything settled, it's a good, music player. It has your album art, lyrics if available and you can feel safe with 200 songs in a playlist. Some music players start to have problems once you have 50 songs in them.

The navigation also can be frustrating at first when you're searching for songs. It wants to search within your Amazon music first, meaning the songs you have either bought or have in a playlist. You have to click on ""in unlimited"" to get it out of your music.

The 4 star is because I'm an optimist, it's more like a 3.5 and I'm rounding it up. The player's functionality is the deciding factor in renewing Amazon Unlimited music. I have about 2 more months to decide and hopefully the player won't give me any problems over that time."

It works beautifully with Spotify, Pandora, etc. and the sound is great.  However, I cannot ask Alexa to play my music/audiobook collection that I did not buy from Amazon.  I read that one could add ""songs"" to My Music in the Amazon Music desktop application and upload those to My Music in the Amazon Cloud where Alexa would be able to access them ... Turns out Amazon discontinued this feature if you are not an Unlimited subscriber.  So, Amazon Music no longer does the one thing I need it to do.  Spotify does more than Amazon Music (and does it well).  We already pay for Spotify, Pandora, Prime and Kindle Unlimited, so I am not interested in paying yet another subscription fee.  I give it 3 stars for being OK at what it does and -1 star for not doing what I need it to do.  Uninstalling it now."

The next song cues, but then just buffers. And buffers....until I click the next song or try to get the current song to play.

It works on my laptop and desk top, just not my Windows tablet.  When I try to reinstall it, I am taken to Amazon assistant which has nothing to do with the music.  I think it may have been the last upgrade that did it.  I use Groove on my tablet now."

175977,1.0,2018,"I'm a total music junky and snob.  I signed up for the Amazon Music Unlimited trial because I wanted a station I can listen to that introduces me to new alternative rock and pop.  I'd used the standard Amazon Prime Music a few times but was getting almost nothing but stuff I already have in my collection.  So I gave Unlimited a try, to see if it would include great new music to expand my knowledge.  It DOES, and it's GREAT.  I listen to what is facially the same ""station"" (Top Alternative Rock), but what it plays is WAY broader and newer.  The programming is awesome, almost like they have a spy in my brain predicting what I'll like.  Great job, Amazon.  I'm fearful of your world domination, but submissive to your powerfully accurate predictions of what fits my life."
175978,1.0,2018,"I liked it but would like to be able to make a play list. If it has this feature already, I haven't found it.

But now, 3 years later, their music options are limited to popular artists. Amazon music is suffering so bad with other genre's (metalcore, progressive metalcore, progressive rock anything really) that I'm forced to use other platforms to satisfy my wanderlust with music. It was a decent run, but it's time for some of us to find a better music service."

175990,1.0,2018,Works very well - especially if you are purchasing and downloading.
175991,-1.0,2018,Did this completely stop working for anyone else today? :(
175992,0.0,2018,"Both versions of the app need a lot of work, and the sync between them needs even more. I've found the layout to be rather clunky, and it takes way more time to find what I'm looking for than with the other various apps I've used to play rips of my physical albums. One example of this is with the Android version. Its interface is strictly vertical, and only up to six artists can be shown on the screen at any given moment. Shrinking the vertical space in the list and tweaking the up/down acceleration would help a ton. A good deal of the UI could use some downsizing in general, and accumulated sorting methods could cut the monotony even more. The mobile app lets you sort by album name, artist name and genre, but that's not really enough. None of these guide you to what you've recently added, which leaves you open to a strange ritual of adding a bunch of music from Unlimited and never seeing it again because you were too busy to listen to the whole album when you added it. It's also peculiar how the Android version lacks the ability to reverse the order of the list. Tediously slogging to the very bottom of my large (and growing) library just to reach the Relayer album by Yes can sometimes make me not even want to bother. Essentially, the app needs more features from the PC version, though even that version has its problems.

The most obvious issue with Music on PC is the slow loading time. I'm unsure whether if it's because the interface is too busy with icons, if it's the number of banners and icons shown or if the app itself is just poorly optimized (my guess is a shade of grey across each option); but, booting the app takes time, the app generally bogs my computer down and it's not even uncommon for pages to glitch out and fail to load anything until I go through Task Manager to restart the program.

Beyond that, perhaps the most frequent and annoying thing I've had to deal with when using Amazon Music has been a shared problem between the two- the absolutely inconsistent account syncing between versions. I add an album on PC? Nowhere to be seen on my phone! I add something on my phone? See no such thing on my PC! Delete something from one? Well, it's still there on the other! This is super obnoxious, and makes the app feel like even more of a chore to use. I've been a Prime member for a long time, and have held out hope they'd fix that, but it really hurts the experience. I've even had many albums and artists that refuse to be deleted on this, that or the other platform until I took the time to delete it song-by-song.

I know someone would suggest directly accessing the site's player through my internet browser, but I'd just respond with asking if they were serious. The browser player's even worse and, quite frankly, the admission such a primitive and and analog streaming page like the URL loader would be preferable to Amazon's proprietary app would seriously raise the question of why they even bothered designing the blasted thing.  Amazon would be wise to improve their Music app, as I've long since abandoned iTunes and I know this nonsense can deter people from forking over money dollars for the Unlimited service. I rate it as highly as I do simply for the service, but everyone has their limits."

176022,-1.0,2018,"EDIT: I did find a way to add music to your phone via offline access. I can't believe I didn't see it or think it. Pluf your phone into your comp and for myself (note 8) I found a folder called ""Amazon MP3"". I would like to ask Amazon to also add to the android app an ""Allmusic"" filter. Right now there is just an offline and cloud filter. Thank you. Still not happy about how I had to do this to get this acomplished.

I really wanted to switch over to amazon music from google play. So, I downloaded all my purchased music form google play thinking i would be able to upload it to Amazon music. Well to my surprise I can't. I can on my computer upload the music into ""offline"" mode. Though, I don't listen to my music on my computer, I listen to it on my phone. Download the app on my phone to see if the offline songs I uploaded are there. Of course they are NOT but I thought maybe it would be. I have 1300 songs and some of which are personal music from my High school orchestras and choirs that I want to keep. I understand that they maybe don't want people uploading illegally downloaded music to their service.

Yes I have amazon prime and there are songs available for ""free"" that you can add to your library (unable to be downloaded though). Again going through and finding over 1000 songs I already have through the library to add seems like too much work to switch over. Again, they still would not be my songs I could keep.

I have spent many hours googling and researching a way to do this and I can't find a solution. I love Amazon in general and use their services daily. I am not re buying over a 1000 songs. I don't see why that I would be willing to switch over.

Amazon please help us out!!!"

I'm not paying more for something you say I was already getting... after this subscription runs out I think our relationship is over Amazon. You getting an ego and I don't appreciate it.

176046,0.0,2018,"I've been looking for a new music app to replace my old one I departed from. Been with Pandora for years, love the algorithm system, but it completely went downhill with the repetitions, including in paid version.

Was glad to see that Amazon has a rather great desktop client (surprisingly most other don't bother), that's clean and easy to navigate, with search option, minimizing option, etc. Basically a full version client as most tend to be a basic player with most attention to the app version.

Music wise I'm still struggling with it after a week or so. At first glance it seems like there's a lot of variety and station but that doesn't seem to be the case. A lot of the stations are unnecessary, especially the ones that are customized for you after some of your choices. Basically each song you hear, the performers become a station that plays (I'm guessing) supposedly similar music but really they all play the same bands. It's possible that this was done on purpose as a marketing move to make the variety appear much broader than it really is. There is one plus though, songs so far rarely repeat, that's refreshing for me coming from Pandora.

I'm also pleased to see the tabs when you reach the bottom of the desktop client where besides the genres you can choose based on your activity. Again however, the ones I've checked out aren't full of many choices. One area desperately needs work. I enjoy instrumental beats quite commonly as it gets me in a productive rhythm on my PC so naturally I checked it on here and wow, caught me off guard. Some of it sounds like it was recorded on one of those cheap DJ'ing software with a bunch of premade licks, sounds, and drums that is impossible to put together out of tune. You know, the ones we all tried in Junior High and got all excited thinking we're totally the best DJ's ever.

Oh and I was glad to see the thumbs up and down choices per song, however I have no idea if it's actually making any difference, so far not really, kind of thought it's just there as a placebo kind of thing but when you don't like a song it does skip it.

I'll stick with it for a while, after all it's better than most alternatives I've already tried out there. I don't know what's the situation with Amazon music, but if I joined in the middle of a facelift then that's a good thing, should get better."

It constantly removes songs from playlists that I put together and even removes songs from my device, while at the same time, it re-downloads entire albums that I've removed to free up space.  It's like the app is doing a system restore to an earlier date, but there seem to be no settings that I can access that would allow me to deal with these issues.  It has become very annoying."

176125,1.0,2018,Excellent selection of music.  Access to songs and artists simple easy to use. Great job!!!!!
176126,1.0,2018,Great App
176127,1.0,2018,Good value
176128,-1.0,2018,"Downloaded the app but can't open it, can't  cancel the subscription. What a pc of shir!!!!"
176129,1.0,2018,"Easy
!"
176130,1.0,2018,Have not tried it on old laptop in my shop thats what I got it for. Will let you know.
176131,1.0,2018,LOVE the Amazon Music app!
176132,0.0,2018,I don't like that it forced itself into the start up menu.
176133,-1.0,2018,Cannot download it to other devices
176134,1.0,2018,I love Amazon Music!
176136,1.0,2018,It worked well. No complaints
176137,1.0,2018,use it daily ... love access to so much music!
176138,1.0,2018,Seems OK
176139,1.0,2018,I like individual albums
176140,1.0,2018,good
176141,1.0,2018,This product is as nonhydrous as you could need. It did the job perfectly and an added bonus is I didn't loose anything ;)
176142,1.0,2018,I have Prime...where are all this free music once the app is downloaded...not as easy as one would think
176143,-1.0,2018,"Music stops playing after a minute or so, but still shows as playing within app.  Very annoying that it repeatedly stops.  The web version has a mind of its own and suddenly changes songs, so it is no better. iOS version works great, wish I could get the same from a PC."
176144,1.0,2018,Easy to listen to your favorites. Just put in a genre and it plays. It also is compatible with Alexa
176145,1.0,2018,Amazon music is the best!!!!
176146,0.0,2018,"This is cool, but I think it should come with Prime!"
176147,0.0,2018,"Fast and easy, but difficult to use in my other music applications"
176148,1.0,2018,Great to listen anywhere
176149,-1.0,2018,it's a great idea other then I should be able to play on anything. But I downloaded this and found it messed up my computer. Researching I found I am not the only one. But it is nice other then that.
176150,1.0,2018,Variety of songs available
176151,1.0,2018,"This is so wonderful. Even though, at 62, Im old school (I believe we should pay for cds, singles etc.) I simply love for one price I can listen to so much music!"
176152,-1.0,2018,"Download, install, use it 2-3 times, un-install.  Repeat infinitely.  New blue version is a nightmare to deal with.  What's up Amazon?"
176153,-1.0,2018,Returned it. Couldn't download any of the music.
176154,-1.0,2018,I could not get it to work.
176155,-1.0,2018,Service is very slow and often freezes when playing certain albums. Amazon really needs to put in more resources to making the service faster + adding more content.
176156,1.0,2018,"It's an awesome app for paid Prime members!!! I love that you can buy song's individually instead of an whole album.. Thanks Amazon staff!!!

Matt"
176157,-1.0,2018,"the app is slow.  It hangs many times.  Always produces an error ""... not responding..."" when you try to quit it.

Besides that, it is hard to use."
176158,0.0,2018,does not have many choices.
176159,1.0,2018,This is fantastic! Tons of music right when you want it!
176160,1.0,2018,I like it. easy to use.
176161,-1.0,2018,"Not sure why it is called Amazon music, but it don't play any songs, at least in Canada."
176162,-1.0,2018,"It is difficult at best to find any explanation as to how Amazon music is supposed to work.
Then Amazon has the brass balls to want to charge me for that information.
You cannot down load music to a file.
You cannot down load music to burn to a CD,
There is lots if music on Amazon Music, however the site is too intricate for the average user, and is confusing at best.
Get your act together, and make this site a lot easier to use.
I did not think that I needed a 4 year degree in order to burn music to a CD.
Not only is the site too complicated, it messed up other programs in my computer."
176163,-1.0,2018,I can't get it to load
176164,1.0,2018,No commercials
176165,1.0,2018,I love the diversity of music available.
176166,1.0,2018,I love listening to the oldies on Amazon Music when I am working at the computer!
176167,1.0,2018,I wrote this review so I could see them thank me for reviewing their product! Yasssss!
176168,1.0,2018,Music!
176169,1.0,2018,"Better than local radio, enjoy all the  variety of different genres I listen to."
176170,1.0,2018,Great servce!!!!!!
176171,-1.0,2018,I thought it was for downloading music to my mp3. Not
176172,1.0,2018,SO FAR NO EXTRA EXPENSE
176173,-1.0,2018,The program seems to be gone.
176174,0.0,2018,It was good other than limited selctions
176175,0.0,2018,I gave it a three because I can't always find what I'm looking for and it slows down my computer really bad making it hard to open or close and I can't use anything else on it. But my computer is old. Navigating is a little confusing at first but otherwise it is easy to use.
176176,1.0,2018,"The app often times is buggy when it's refreshing the library, but i like it"
176177,-1.0,2018,Buggy app on Win 10. Works fine for a while and then does not launch at all. Then I have to reinstall the app and the whole cycle repeats itself! Less convenient to use the browser based music player but it is more reliable.
176178,1.0,2018,ok
176179,1.0,2018,Arrived as described.  I was pleased with purchase
176181,1.0,2018,I like the download on pc. Makes it easier.
176182,1.0,2018,Great
176183,-1.0,2018,Worse product / Service in the world - I hate it. Not compatible for WIN 10.
176184,1.0,2018,A massive music collection (why did I buy Itunes?). It's a bit pricey  for the family plan @ $140/yr.
176185,1.0,2018,"Very easy to use and includes lots of (for me at least) obscure artists (Psy Aviah, Neuroticfish, Frozen Plasma, etc.) as well as most of the popular artists."
176186,-1.0,2018,Not. Impressed. What happened to alllll my offline music?
176187,0.0,2018,Lots of tech issues.  Sometimes stops in mid-song.  Sometimes stops after 3 songs.  Sometimes runs flawlessly.  You'd think they have the resources to make it perfect . . .
176188,-1.0,2018,Waste of time can not even fond the music I had bought in the past
176189,0.0,2018,have not used much
176190,0.0,2018,Too much selling...
176191,-1.0,2018,would like to cancel but cant figure out how thanks
176192,-1.0,2018,"When I click on the ""Download Icon"" and nothing happens.  Tech support hard to find.  Beware."
176193,-1.0,2018,"If I could make a playlist that didn't involve music only downloaded from Amazon, I might actually use this program."
176194,1.0,2018,Love it
176195,1.0,2018,didn't really use it but hey its there
176196,1.0,2018,love to leasing to my music
176197,1.0,2018,Love it!
176198,1.0,2018,great
176199,-1.0,2018,"500 song limit to playlist; music comes & goes -- some music is available at some times then will randomly disappear & no longer be available.. just like what happens with Amazon Video... for being the wealthiest man of all times, one would think Amazon's founder & CEO would be able to offer a consistent product when it comes to music & movies..."
176200,0.0,2018,Ok
176201,-1.0,2018,I did not want another crappy media library as in  I-tunes look-alike. I only need a downloader not 32 MB of wasted space. Since that is no longer available I will buy music elsewhere.
176202,1.0,2018,works great
176203,1.0,2018,"I so well
I listen to it ever day"
176204,1.0,2018,love it
176205,1.0,2018,You took me right to my Jazz.
176206,1.0,2018,as advertised
176207,-1.0,2018,"Amazon makes it easy to buy a song, but after that it is a complete time waster.  Where are my songs?  When I add one to a playlist I make in Windows Media, it will refuse to play after a short time.  And finding the downloaded tune?  Good luck with that.  WMP, my PC - no search turns up most of these downloaded tunes.  Really, really sucks."
176208,1.0,2018,Love the APP
176209,-1.0,2018,"I never ordered or used it
Make sure there are no change to my account"
176210,-1.0,2018,"I absolutely can not use this app with out it eventually crashing and disappearing from my PC. It crashes and I can not open it again unless I reinstall the app.  It's like the EXE isn't there any more.
Just one more reason I am disliking Amazon more and more."
176211,-1.0,2018,"It was ok but now I can't upload my own music anymore. They have ""discontinued"" the upload feature. Even though I am a music unlimited customer there are still lots of songs not offered. I was only trying to fill the deficiency in Amazon's selection but apparently that isn't going to happen any more... Useless app if you have one of the smart home pucks. Guess I'll have to blue tooth the songs Amazon is unable or unwilling to host."
176212,1.0,2018,LOVE IT
176213,0.0,2018,"Good music selection after I spent hours trying to figure out how the website worked.  It is not well laid out, meager instructions, different selection methods on different pages and non intuitive icons.  When will software developers start testing their products on non-geeks?"
176214,1.0,2018,Allows a good music library.
176215,1.0,2018,I love that it is like karoke has the lyrics as they sing.
176216,1.0,2018,good addition to Alexa
176217,1.0,2018,best thing ever.
176219,1.0,2018,Great selection of music.
176220,1.0,2018,I love the reasonable access to many hard-to-find digital songs for downloading.
176221,1.0,2018,"Literally any music a person could want to listen to. I treasure, all music and Amazon Music fills that Bill."
176222,1.0,2018,It works perfectly
176223,1.0,2018,this has always treated my right. I have found music that i can only find on amazon. I am a fan
176224,1.0,2018,Best I've ever used.
176225,-1.0,2018,Sadly all it did was put amazon prime on my browser. That's was a bit of help since I wanted to listen to music.
176226,-1.0,2018,"I thought there was no charge to this, but when you try to start up it is blocked until you give them a credit card for a monthly payment.  I deleted it from my computer."
176227,-1.0,2018,Did not run poperly soon after I tried to play some of my music... crashed !
176228,1.0,2018,great listening to music.
176229,1.0,2018,Great!
176230,-1.0,2018,when music loaded it would not respond without my exiting  it and reopening it ....and then it would do only one thing and I would have to closeout and reopen again to do the next thing...and so on ad-infitum....wont load music from windows media player...or download to wmp....both of which it used to do.....totally useless for what I had been doing......I have downloaded it numerous times and it always does the same thing
176231,-1.0,2018,it wouldn't download
176232,1.0,2018,And I pay for GOOGLE play music
176233,1.0,2018,Works as described

176235,1.0,2018,Love having on my phone
176236,1.0,2018,This is great just wished I could download
176237,1.0,2018,"It, I think goes without saying that this is the best app for listening to your music!"
176238,0.0,2018,"Adding tracks to a playlist is a real PITA as it is so slow most of the time. The cursor spins and spins and often returns a timeout error so you have to try again.

Update: Got so fed up with how slow the app is that I have cancelled my sub. I would not recommend this service to anyone until they release a music app that actually works properly. There is a history of people reporting performance problems with this app yet it is still the same old same old."
176239,1.0,2018,GR8 for music lovers
176240,1.0,2018,"I love the service, and still learning the things it can do. I'm so grateful Amazon is working to improve the desktop app. Just wish they would design a UWP app for all Windows devices and especially one for the Xbox One, which still till this day do not have one. I have a sound bar for my tv and even though i love playing music through my Echo, i'd prefer using my Xbox and sound bar to play music once and awhile, but can't do that, because there is no Music app. Unless they have an app on the Fire TV stick, which i don't know about, since i don't have one yet. Update, finally they made an app in the Windows store, now they just need to bring it to the Xbox one."
176241,1.0,2018,love my music downloads.

176247,1.0,2018,iI LOVE THE MUSIC
176248,1.0,2018,"Great selection, whole albums are especially nice.  Christian music selection is great. Interface is great, going to order the family plan so my wife can maintain her own music list and use it at the same time as I do."
176249,1.0,2018,good for streaming
176250,0.0,2018,Many varities of music but alot of music that is the B side of the artist. Never heard of most of the songs.
176251,0.0,2018,Creating own playlists but discontinue of upload to cloud is a big minus. Can no longer create own playlists for Echo.
176252,-1.0,2018,I have downloaded this lousy program 6 times. it wouldn't run after each download. They should have left the original alone. This has cost you a lot of business from my end.
176253,-1.0,2018,"Once again, the old stuff works better!!"
176254,-1.0,2018,Dang shame I can't make this a zero come on Amazon pick it up was a good deal now it's a waste of my time rather use any of the free music apps.bout rite the greedy always seem to ruin everything!!!!
176255,1.0,2018,Nice promotional deal of .99 for 3 months and is great for long road trips whether you have Internet access or not. Only downside is that I couldn't listen to music from other parts of the world that I could on other music apps.
176256,1.0,2018,Prime is worth the price just for the music.
176257,1.0,2018,great
176258,1.0,2018,"great app every kind of music there is at you""re fingertips.great selection actually its better than google play music.i would reconmend Amazon music to anyone.its defitnly for the music lover.i give it a 5 star"
176259,0.0,2018,"I like the interface and organizing my music. But I don't like buying the music and having it not Automatically download at the time of purchase. If I don't manually download a song immediately after purchase, it is difficult to find later to download it."
176260,1.0,2018,Good music service.
176261,0.0,2018,more and more music moving to paid category.  Glitches that cause all of your music to disappear.  An interface that annoys you by trying to upsell you all of the time.
176262,0.0,2018,I'm a 70's music fan and use the 70's station supplied by Amazon. They play some good songs from that time period but there are a lot missing. It would be nice to have more variety from that period.
176263,1.0,2018,I haven't been able to use it yet
176264,1.0,2018,"A year ago I would have given this app 5 stars! Lately though, a lot of the music I used to have access to, has now crossed over into the 'Unlimited Music' (ie PAID) app. And every few months it seems I lose more music and when I do I will revisit this and drop another star off the review.

Amazon is a BILLION DOLLAR company that charges people $100 a year to be 'prime members'. Lately I feel like I have gotten less for my money though. This is just another example of that."
176265,1.0,2018,Everything was Great!!!! Never had any problems ever.
176266,1.0,2018,"Tricky to download but works quite well once done! If you have a new Microsoft 10 plan on spending some time getting it right !
My new HP Desktop is doing well with the tiny HP speakers available from Amazon too!  Can't believe such tiny things do so well ....."
176267,1.0,2018,I love this app for listening to my music at work.
176268,1.0,2018,So worth it!
176269,1.0,2018,Great Music on the go
176270,1.0,2018,"This may not have the biggest selection of music, but I'm happy with it, and it just adds more value to  amazon prime."

176272,1.0,2018,Sounds great!
176273,1.0,2018,Quick delivery great product.
176274,-1.0,2018,It doesn't work - won't install.
176275,-1.0,2018,App wouldnt open or work on PC
176276,1.0,2018,Great music to hear!!!!
176277,1.0,2018,"The sound quality is great, the headset is comfortable and can be worn for a long time.  The music is quite good having a  great variety of old and new makes it very interesting.  I'm a fan of Elvis and the albums with his songs arer terrific.  I am 74 yrs. young and enjoy all genres and everything from the Forties on up to the current hits.including Country and Classical."
176280,1.0,2018,love the selections and so much to choose from great
176281,1.0,2018,Love this app!! Take my personal music with me wherever I go.
176282,-1.0,2018,"i really liked this app, had no problems or issues - until today.  The app just hangs up and says ""restoring your local playlists.."". problem is I don't have any. After 30 minutes and 4 attempts at restarting and rebooting, I still get the same thing. Sorry Amazon but if it is easier to go somewhere else to listen to your own music then people will do just that."
176283,0.0,2018,"I have found it difficult to download my music from this app. I also cannot get an icon to my LG G6. I had lots of trouble trying to download to Windows Media Player and to put into my One Drive. All kinds of routes, but I finally got my music into my phone from my laptop. Android."
176284,-1.0,2018,I think I hated it simply because I wasn't sure how to use it.  I am OLD and need directions
176285,-1.0,2018,"I wanted an App for my phone; I did not have that option. I have never opened it because I was gifted an Amazon dot for Christmas. I intended to purchase certain songs to add to my playlist and play them utilizing Alexa. The only options for downloads were for a PC. I have never opened it or used it. One of my requirements as a Project Engineer with, ""The Shaw Group"" for 25 years was to condense hundreds of pages of specifications into  a version that a third grader could understand it. Amazon has never gotten close to that with the Dot or how to use the music. I am not happy, nor am I satisfied. If I could provide a half star for my satisfaction, I would."
176286,-1.0,2018,Does not work with windows 10.

176295,1.0,2018,"good service, a lot of choices"
176296,1.0,2018,Good software but the interface is so bland. It reminds me of Spotify there just doesn't seem to have any distinguishable look to it. It does a good job and let's me buy some albums for sale.
176297,1.0,2018,Great music program it has an excellent library and enjoy overall service
176298,1.0,2018,"Seems on par with iHearth Radio and the rest.  A bit of a CPU hog - especially at the start -, but OK."

176310,-1.0,2018,"I've un-installed and re-installed this useless app on my Windows 10 computer several times. The last time I did so I was brought to this page and asked me to order the app. So I did, and was thanked for my order. And that was it. No offer to download that app, nothing.  However, when I clicked on the add for Amazon Prime Music I was taken to a screen that offered all of my music, and I was able to access it. I was then offered to download the app after I clicked to download my music. I ignored it and accessed my music directly from Amazon. So there is a work around, but this is a ridiculous set up and Amazon needs to work on it."
176311,1.0,2018,Good music
176312,-1.0,2018,"This month alone, it has crashed twice. One of the times it crashed while I was deep into a paper and I lost a significant chunk of my work.
The layout is odd and requires a learning curve to figure out where the 'secret doors' are located to activate certain prompts (e.g., if you want to view the album cover, you have to click in a very specific dead-space around the 'play' button"
176313,0.0,2018,"Music sounds GREAT! Issue is I am FORCED to keep prime for music (I don't order enough yet to justify Prime. Thus forcing me to Spotify, Napster, and others"

And it left my TV screen littered with a record of every song I played on my computer.  I couldn't get any help on these issues.  Just the opportunity to purchase more Amazon products.  Not happening."
176318,-1.0,2018,"Can't seem to listen to all the music I downloaded, whenever I'm not around Wi-Fi.  What's the point?"
176319,0.0,2018,Using Amazon unlimited has not been intuitive for me. I'm very disappointed at the amount of time devoted to using the service. I have 90 days free and I'm not at all sure I will stick with it given the time spent figuring it out thus far. Not at all impressed. Can't figure out why everyone seems to think it's so wonderful.
176320,-1.0,2018,Did not use it so I deleted it.
176321,-1.0,2018,"Where is the music I uploaded to Amazon cloud, and the purchases of music I bought from Amazon a few years ago.  I refuse to buy Elton John Yellow Brick road again."

176324,-1.0,2018,"Streaming is always an issue. Even if you downloaded the song it will try and dial in to the server and not let you play the song until it does. I have no problem with Pandora, Spotify or Rhapsody (when it was around). Improve streaming or don't make it required to sign in every time to play a downloaded song. In its current state its unusable."
176325,0.0,2018,i like everything about Amazon Music!  With the exception of issues with the program itself.  When I close the program it does not actually close.  It continues to run in the background and hog both memory and CPU resources.  I am running a fully updated Windows 10 using Explorer.  I have to use Task Manager to end the Amazon Music application.

176328,0.0,2018,"What did I like most? The selections were phenomenal! What did I like least? I can't keep the song after membership expires. I can't download it to another device. It's kind of ridiculous to pay a monthly fee (when there are so many free options out there) and I am not allowed to ""keep"" my selections."
176329,1.0,2018,as expected

176331,-1.0,2018,"This has become infuriating. I buy songs from Amazon, and cannot get Amazon Music to load in order to download and burn them on my computer. It never loads anymore, full stop. I can't listen to songs, make playlists, do anything. Alexa, additionally, has lost a lot of her capabilities to respond to simple commands. Amazon, you're getting too big for your britches. Fix this please."
176332,1.0,2018,Ok
176333,-1.0,2018,"Well, if I could have figured out how to download the song I am sure I would have enjoyed it . Followed your instructions and just could not make it work. If I could give it no stars I would!"
176334,-1.0,2018,"Be forwarned that I have just spent th4 afternoon trying to uninstlll this peice of crap application from my Windows 10 pc. I installed the app and then tried to launch it. Nothing progree bar for a few seconds then nothing. Click again, same results. Restart, same result. Try to uninstall this trash and it get to the this will take a few mintes screen then nothing, open the task manager no movement on the uninstaller. Restart, same result so now i cant get this -ice of junk from my computer. If I was Amazon Id be embarassed to have an app so completly terrible (my first try with Amazon music app last year was basically the same). Any one know how I can get this crap off my pc?"

176336,1.0,2018,Good!! ladygamblertina@yahoo.com
176337,0.0,2018,Needs a clearer interface for streaming music that you haven't purchased.  Doesn't allow you to save streaming channels.  Doesn't show you which songs you've voted up or down - unless you own them.  Love the unlimited skip back/forward options as you can easily replay a song you like & even jump forward in the current song - something Pandora and Napster simply don't allow.
176338,1.0,2018,"Wow, love it.  Didn't know it came with my Prime Membership, but the music alone is worth it.  Amazon blows Pandora out of the water.  I don't know who organizes the music lists, but they are phenomenal.  Better take care of them and pay them well.  Kudos."
176339,1.0,2018,This service is incomparable to others.  I love it and I would definitely buy it again.  I will definitely be a long-term subscriber!

176353,-1.0,2018,"Essentially, THIS app is worthless for PC.

I was excited when I discovered this APP for pc. I downloaded it and then realized that I can't download any songs other than the ones I buy, but if you use the mobile version you can download anything. This is the most idiotic thing I have ever seen. If for whatever reason it IS for theft, well Amazon, you just made me want to figure out a way to steal the songs I have on my mobile app and move them to my pc. Where there is a will, there is a way.

This is seriously asinine and this app is total CRAP because of it, no one wants to #1 waste data and #2 listen to crappy audio on their phones or through the internet."
176354,-1.0,2018,Lots of questions.
176355,-1.0,2018,"I cancelled to app. Reason: there is no real explanation how to use it. I wanted to store my own music and I could not find a way how to do it. For me the app is useless, maybe not for others."
176356,1.0,2018,My playlist gets larger every day.  Easy to add tunes.

176361,-1.0,2018,did not like it
176362,1.0,2018,Excellent
176363,0.0,2018,"I love the music, however, I wanted the Echo plan and mistakenly ended up getting the $9.99 mo. plan. After paying for the first month, I canceled the plan (I tried to cancel immediately but was still charged). Now I am unable to start the Echo plan. Alexa tells me that I am scheduled for cancellation the next billing cycle and will not allow me to add the Echo plan. I cannot add the Echo plan manually on line. This is messed up."
176364,-1.0,2018,"This app has gotten worse and more buggy over time, but this is the last straw.

Under ""Songs"", not a single track appears. If I click ANYTHING ELSE, albums, artists, playlists, GENRES, I can find my music. But I can't automatically access a single listing with every track based on that level of granularity, and this only occurs on one device. My primary Windows 10 PC. I thought maybe there was a corrupted cache, and so I decided that maybe if I uninstall the app, then reinstall it, the cache would clear and reload, allowing me to view my whole library. In effect, I have a database on my PC that acknowledges viewing things on every level save for an individual row.

Well, the uninstall utility doesn't even work. So the app, which I pay an annual fee to have cloud storage for the music I own(which is far beyond even what Unlimited offers in many genres), can't even be uninstalled from my PC to try and get it working again. This is only one of many examples of Amazon audio libraries doing poorly with random bits of media. There are, for example, certain Audible audiobooks that won't ever play on Chrome or even the Echo, but will play when downloaded to the cellphone app or streamed but only through Edge."
176365,1.0,2018,I like the minmize function to free up desktop dpace and the hover--pause and hover--rate features.
176366,0.0,2018,"I never thought that I would say this about AMAZON, the Pioneer of Consumer Internet Usability. You blew it! The consumer does not come first anymore.... do we, at least not in your music business?.

Here is a challenge for your Usability Tester: Be a Premier User who wants to simply purchase and download specific songs.
- how do I find this capability the first time? (Hint - this cannot be found on the primary navigation, not even secondary)
- how many clicks to get there every subsequent time? (the same as the first time is my guess)
- Now, I want to download to MusicBee on my machine and establish that I do not want your App. Did you usability test this? (took me 6 times)
- Why were my files and folders zipped automatically? Shouldn't I have been able to choose? (i'm guessing the apps must unzip music)
- Why was I not allowed to select the folder destination? (this was just rude)

After years, I just quit iTunes, whose newest version ripped thousands of tunes off of my computer (that i had loaded from my own CDs, which I subsequently donated years ago) into their ""cloud"" when I tapped Genius and my collection of 7,500+ tunes became 849 tunes. I do not want to use any music app with a cloud interface that offers all kinds of services they cannot control. I pay for my music, I own it. At issue with so many music providers are licensing issues that they have on the other side. That should be their problem, not mine. That is why my music management software will remain separate from my music streaming/purchase software, which is why Amazon should not create a cumbersome design which attempts to force users to use your app. I trust you continue to make money on music purchases, so please fix your user interface. You are, after all, Amazon."
176367,1.0,2018,Enjoyed music. Thanks.
176368,1.0,2018,good App has simplified things.
176369,-1.0,2018,Stopped working and playing songs in library.  It is there but I can't buy all the songs I bought on amazon anymore.
176370,-1.0,2018,"It's incredibly unfortunate that Amazon has taken an already clunky program that was worth dealing with ONLY because it allowed the upload and management of our personal music collections, in the form of MP3 files (albeit as a fairly lossy rate) to the cloud, and is tanking it.  Not only is the subscription service being discontinued, so that anyone who is not subscribed by halfway through this month will be unable to subscribe in the future (and anyone whose subscription lapses will also be unable to re-subscribe), but they're not going to allow streaming of the songs people have previously uploaded to free storage (which were already limited to a laughable 250 songs, especially when compared with the 50,000 songs that Google allows users to store and stream for free).  At least they're giving people some warning about the discontinuation - 1 year to download those stored songs that you're no longer allowed to stream, folks, and then they'll be deleted!  In addition, it's not really, truly clear if the paid subscriptions will be ""storage only,"" or if they will also allow streaming, and if they will allow streaming, if it will be in all the capacities in which it was previously allowed, or if it will be restricted to certain devices and platforms.

For shame, Amazon."

204731,-1.0,2018,"I bought this about 8 months ago.  At first, it was OK but I would not have given it more than a 3 star rating because the card selection isn't all the easy to filter and I was disappointed that there were no cards that included main characters that kids like - you know the kind, those they relate to in cartoons and such.
Now though I barely give it a one because the software stopped working and I have been struggling to get any help from Nova Development.  When I go to their website there is no technical help at all - you can't even leave an email to be contacted later.  When I call the number for the company, the automated answering system does have an option for technical assistance but all I have ever gotten is a voice mail that says the company's hours are Monday - Friday 6 AM to 6 PM PST.  Everyone of my tries were always within this time frame.
DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE.  IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS THERE IS NO ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE.  Very disappointing!!!!!!"
204732,-1.0,2018,"I had higher hopes for this software.  I wanted to make birthday invitation's for my son's 1st birthday. I found an invitation on Pinterest I liked and I thought ""Oh I'll buy this software, I can come up with something similar"".  Nope.  I spent several hours trying to create an invitation.  All of the graphics I used were copied and pasted from online.  The graphics provided with this software are mediocre, poor selection.  The font selection is no better than what you get using MS Word.  Using the disk, the home screen has a 'bonus font' button all it does it bring up a bunch of file folders and you click on each folder there are families of fonts in the folder.  You have to click on the font to open another window to see what the font looks like, then you can download it if you want.  I'm not spending 16 hours digging through font folders.  I could not find a way to download all the fonts at once.  This might be better suited for someone who wants to use a template to create a card or brochure.  I found this software to be inadequate for creating a custom/from scratch birthday invitation."

205655,1.0,2018,NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THERE PRODUCTS
205656,1.0,2018,"Excellent program, runs in the background. I had not used Anti-Virus protection in years, as Macintosh is ""relatively"" immune. I had recently downloaded 'Mac Cleaner' and that is when the apparent problems began. Virtually every time I clicked while running Safari, I would get a new screen 'warning' of a new virus infection. These screens looked official and many appeared to be actual Apple sites. I once followed the prompts and ultimately this led to a ""purchase screen"" for their 'advanced' product. I seems that the program was loaded with issues that automatically prompted virus alerts.
Webroot cleared all these issues on the first scan. I am sure other brands of virus protection work well. In the 'olden days - from 1987 to 2008.... I still have my first Mac SE',  I used Norton software, which worked extremely well for protection, backup, etc.  Since purchasing my first laptop in 2008; however, no additional protection software seemed necessary, at the time. Times have changed. I tried Trend Micro, but had download issues from the vendor, and finally requested and received a refund. After reading multiple reviews, I selected Webroot and so far, am pleased.
This Webroot program offers protection at a reasonable price."
205657,1.0,2018,Fewest problem of all anti-virus I have used.
205658,1.0,2018,Gets the job done and uses only a minute/almost negligible amount of computer resources.
205659,1.0,2018,Never used this product before and please with the outcome.
205661,1.0,2018,Returned for a refund because I meant to purchase the Webroot Internet Security Plus w/ Antivirus. Thanks!!
205662,1.0,2018,"Works as advertised, but beware you will lose any time left on the license you are updating. This loss cost them 1 star in my rating.

Wait until you only have a day or two remaining on your active license before you activate."
205663,1.0,2018,to my knowledge its okay.
205664,1.0,2018,"Been using webroot for 3 years i think and it has saved me a couple of times. countless scans have turned up nothing. so i am hoping that is a good thing. scans are much faster than kaspersky, so i think it is better but i really don't know for sure."
205675,1.0,2018,I have been using Webroot Antivirus for several years and have been well pleased with the security protection. I advise those who wish to try it and see if it will be what you are looking for.
205676,1.0,2018,"Light weight, but yet effective at safeguarding PC"
205677,-1.0,2018,"I could not download this software without the keycode. Inside the software package there is a space for the keycode, but no keycode was listed. This is very insulting to any paying customer. And to add further insult to injury, the customer service rep at Webroot, in a condescending tone of voice, told me that I need to contact Amazon, which I did. Amazon was at a loss at to how they can resolve my dilemma."
205678,1.0,2018,seems to work fine doesn't use all my processor power while running like McAfee and Norton did to my computer it also found a threat that McAfee never did.
205679,1.0,2018,I have been using webroot for a while now and been very happy with it.
205680,1.0,2018,so far so good.
205681,-1.0,2018,Why can I not download my Webroot Antivirus program?
205682,1.0,2018,I have used webroot for a few years now and for the price I don't think it can be beat.
205683,1.0,2018,I've been using Webroot Antivirus Protection for many years. It is a name that I trust and I would definitely recommend.
205684,1.0,2018,best for under 20 bucks
205685,1.0,2018,"Works well, has given me some piece of mind"
205687,0.0,2018,I much prefer Norton
205688,1.0,2018,"seems to work well, replaced Kaspersky with this, faster,"
205690,0.0,2018,Big problems upon first install on my 2 laptops; blue and black screens. I would never advise anyone to buy this product.  Hours of troubleshooting.
205691,1.0,2018,A++++++++++
205692,1.0,2018,"Was one day before I was due to renew my subscription. Had already ordered disc at good savings over online cost.  Went to auto install and kept bringing up renew now screen.

205693,1.0,2018,"Great product , cheaper than Norton, cheaper than stuff available at costco."
205694,1.0,2018,Excellent protection.
205705,1.0,2018,"Still great protection, and it doesn't bog down your machine while running. We've never had a problem with viruses in the years we've been using Weroot."

205707,1.0,2018,Very nice and easy to install.

205709,-1.0,2018,"The program would not load. I bought the disc to update Secure Anywhere from 2017 to 2018. After inserting the disc into my computer, nothing would download. I was not given anywhere to input the new product key. The only option I was given was to renew Secure Anywhere online, through Webroot's Website for $32.49. I'm in the process of returning this to Amazon for a refund. I'm going to give Norton a try, and see if I have better luck with them."
205710,1.0,2018,installed and running. thanks
205711,1.0,2018,works in the background without being intrusive like other antivirus programs do.  Does not slow your startup either! yet it is there and detected 3 infections I had that Norton anti virus had not detected.
205712,1.0,2018,"Easy install, low pc resource usage, fast scanning. I have been virus and malware free since install. Highly recommended."
205713,0.0,2018,"Might be better off just using Windows' built in antivirus over this. The software has too many notifications for my tastes, and you'd be better off without it. If you want a more efficient AV, go get Kaspersky, or just use the default software and only go to websites you trust (also, always be careful browsing the internet). Stay safe."
205725,1.0,2018,"The best product hands down for PC, fast, reliable and barely uses any disk space or system resources. For Mac however, I feel other competing product s are better suited for that task."
205726,1.0,2018,I have tried many Anti Virus programs over the years. Webroot is clearly the easiest to use and it is not intrusive. It pretty much stays in the background doing its thing.
205727,1.0,2018,Very good
205728,-1.0,2018,"I had Kaspersky for 4-years. no viruses, Webroot 1-month and had a lock computer notice while in youtube.  Ran a scan, nothing found? Found a way to get ride of it from a public forum. Not impressed."

205730,1.0,2018,i like it
205731,1.0,2018,"One of the best antivirus programs available, in my opinion.  It works quietly in the background without using a lot of system resources.  I've used other programs which seemed to slow down my system (i7 with 8 g)."

205733,1.0,2018,Great!
205734,1.0,2018,"I have been using this product, for about,  maybe four to five years.  Not bad, for the price, and very useful."
205755,1.0,2018,Recommend it.
205756,1.0,2018,I highly recommend Webroot security products. This is my 3rd years buying their products.
205757,-1.0,2018,"The product could not clean viruses on the system. It runs fully, states that it found and cleaned viruses but it finds more and more with every scheduled check/run. Will have to find a stronger anti-viruses."

205778,1.0,2018,"Sincerely I did not know this product before. I found it looking for the cheapest security product for home use. So far, I like the feature that I do not need to update the virus database. It also does not drop performance too much. It's great product for the price it has.

206175,1.0,2018,"I have utilized many of the competition to WEBROOT security software. I have used Norton, McAfee, Kaspersky, and most recently Bitdefender under annual subscriptions. This year when my Bitdefender subscription came up for renewal I decided to try WEBROOT SecureAnywhere instead of renewing with Bitdefender. WEBROOT has proven to be superior to all the other security software I have used in multiple areas of performance. It works in the background while you do your work, it has kept my multiple home and business PC's running free of issues. When I called with questions WEBROOT's Colorado Help Desk was quick to answer my questions. The program downloaded quickly without any issues. It is the first Security Software I have used that is there immediately upon restarting or booting up my PC's. I have been using it for a month and all my PC's have been running free of any issues. The internet protection is excellent for immediately flagging any sites that may be hazardous to your computers health! My sons are PC gamers and we have always had issues with past Security software from their gaming. We have had none so far with WEBROOT SecureAnywhere.  I can highly recommend this for your home or small business computer protection."
206176,1.0,2018,Quick delivery and was easy to upload to my computer
206178,1.0,2018,Good value and fast shipping
206179,1.0,2018,"I have used Webroot now for several years and I wouldn't have any reason to consider switching to one of the other brands. I've never had a problem with my PCs so obviously it works well.  Webroot seems less expensive, easy to use and understand, and their customer service is excellent when you need them !!"
206180,1.0,2018,"I bought this largely because one of my computers is still running Windows XP, and many antivirus products have dropped support for XP. I have Webroot running on three PCs and one laptop. So far, Webroot is doing its job handsomely. Very pleased."
206191,0.0,2018,"It scans fast, but my computer doesn`t run as well as it did when I used Kaspersky."
206193,1.0,2018,"Been using Webroot for more than 10 years, great protection and fast, still love it."
206194,1.0,2018,"after 4 months' use, I think this is the best of the best-known security software. I am wary of the fact that they automatically renew after a year at their top price... I'll have to watch out for that."
206195,1.0,2018,"I have been using Webroot for a few months, and have actually seen it proactively detect and remove a malware tracker from a (supposedly clean/trusted) Windows utility program downloaded from the Internet. The protection is otherwise invisible.. no slowdown or constant upadtes to download. Thank you Webroot!"
206196,1.0,2018,"tried all the big boys, hands down my favorite"
206197,1.0,2018,"What I like the most about this product is the speed at which it scans my computer for viruses, malware, etc. I also like the support that you can get if you have a question regarding its various features.
I highly recommend this product."
206198,1.0,2018,We've used this product for over 13 years with no issues at all.
206199,1.0,2018,It doesn't slow down my computers and customer support is excellent.
206200,1.0,2018,fast great software feel safe again
206224,1.0,2018,"I love WEBROOT, never had a virus on my pc or phone."
206225,1.0,2018,Webroot runs incredibly fast compared to the anti-virus on my old machine. No issues at all.
206226,1.0,2018,Love this product and five downloads too.
206227,1.0,2018,Our desktop PC is secure!
206228,-1.0,2018,Would not work! Did nothing? Would not install?
206229,-1.0,2018,Its not 2018.  Its 2017. And bin used. F. ...
206230,1.0,2018,Love
206231,-1.0,2018,"I would've given it 4 starts.  Easy to use, relatively light weight, seems to have kept me secure.(for 11 months)
HOWEVER, with a little more than a month left on my subscription it began extremely invasive behaviors, endless pop ups to renew, constant warning signs and a ""grayed out"" menu bar icon.  Now with 23 days left on my subscription it has crippled my VPN not allowing me to connect until I had to close down my VPN.  Now I am hanging out in the wind with ZERO Protection.
AGAIN, over 3 weeks left on my subscription.
BTW- the renewal rate they are forcing me to sign up with is $79.99 a year!!!!
I submitted a ticket on their online ""support"" page.
I got an email back stating it will be 48 HOURS before I can expect a reply.
Called their phone support number.  After 5 minutes of recorded announcement describing all the various ways I can go screw off rather than get real support, they finally announce that my wait for an online agent will be at least 25 minutes.
 Not sure what happened to Webroot?!?!  I called the customer service number given to re-subscribe and after describing my problem was given the advice to uninstall the app.  I asked, ""you mean and go to another company????"".....""Yes"".  I said thanks and goodbye.  Goodbye Webroot."
206232,1.0,2018,Highly Recommend
206233,1.0,2018,"Fantastic product!  Customer service is superb.  I've been using their service for the past three years and their product does what it says..... reliably.  Caught a malware in my system and they able to take care of it, first through email then by phone.  Would recommend WebRoot to anyone looking for internet security."
206244,1.0,2018,"I've finally found the best comprehensive antivirus solution with Webroot. I've tried so many others, most recently Kaspersky and Bitdefender (both of which are top rated), but I still prefer Webroot. Bitdefender would just hog my memory and slow down my PC and Android device, but Webroot runs seamlessly in the background. No impact to performance at all, and I know I am constantly protected. Webroot is a GREAT product!"
206245,1.0,2018,Great price and product
206247,1.0,2018,Very fast scane !!!. Don't slow computer. Complete protection
206248,1.0,2018,So far it seems like it's doing a good job. Easy to install and use.
206249,1.0,2018,"Have been using Webroot for years and have always been satisfied.
Very fast and always up to date. Very low overhead."
206250,1.0,2018,Works in the background. Doesn't slow my computer down!
206251,-1.0,2018,"This did not copy all my information.  In fact, only a small amount was transferred.  Carol Harvey"
206252,1.0,2018,"A great product if you want peace of mind.  I've used it for over 2 years, and it has never failed me.  Very easy to use and automatically updates itself without slowing down my system.  You can also update it manually.  Their customer service, according to my experience, is superlative."
206253,-1.0,2018,"I bought this product and found out that it didn't work on my computer so I sent it back two days later. I was credited $3.73 as a refund. I am more than upset. Next time, I will go to Costco or BJ's to purchase antivirus where I will get a full refund for my returns if I am not satisfied with the product I purchase."
206274,1.0,2018,Used for last few years - no problems with viruses!!
206275,1.0,2018,Works great on desktop and laptops. Have used for 5 years and never had a problem. Webroot stopped several problems over the years.
206276,1.0,2018,I was very pleased it works very well
206277,1.0,2018,"I've had Webroot installed for about 6 weeks now.  This replaced Kaspersky Total Security.  I run Windows 10 Home on an older Dell laptop.  I can only presume Webroot is doing what it says it is.  It runs a scan every day in the background and it is hardly noticeable.  Kaspersky used all but freeze my system for hours.  Task manager would show 100% disk or 98% CPU usage.  Kaspersky would run a rootkit scan and a quick scan at least once a day,  One complaint I have about webroot is there are no logs or reports (that I've been able to find thus far) to review its activity.  I'm very pleased with how my system is running.  I spent a couple days reading reviews on various packages and this seemed highly rated."
206278,-1.0,2018,"I want to start by saying that I am in no way an expert about computers or software.  I installed this yesterday on my laptop computer.  About an hour after installation, I got a visual and a verbal message from a scam.  A large box popped up and a woman's voice said, ""Hello Comcast customer.  You are one of two customers chosen today to win an iphone 8"" (there were also three other choices) The only way to get out of it was to click ""OK"" so I had to shut the computer down to get out of it.  On the Webroot package it has a list of protections including:  1. Blocks fake websites that can steal your personal information,  2. warns you of potentially dangerous sites and links before you click.  I guess I find it strange that this happened an hour after Webroot was installed after never seeing anything like this before.  I don't know what this means but it has diminished my faith in this product."
206279,1.0,2018,Always used webroot will use again
206280,-1.0,2018,"It's done nothing but block me out of my own account. I used 2 on my computer and one on my phone of the 5 (same computer)

either a virus has blocked it's full install or this thing was hacked out the gate. I mean the password I put in worked for a week then stopped. I reinstall it created a secondary account telling me my email was already used (yet there was nothing to get my password back.. the forgot password part didn't work right. )  I'm confused as to why this is happening. I used webroot in the past and it seemed to work fine.  The one on the phone bogged it down, and I started getting tons of ads.  I'm stumped as to why this is happning."
206281,-1.0,2018,My computer kept crashing and I went back to my kaspersky so unhappy paid for this and couldn't even use it
206283,1.0,2018,It does its job well and QUIETLY. No frequent popups. No constant interruptions and REPEATED approval requests.
206294,1.0,2018,I have owned this product for several years and had no problems.
206295,1.0,2018,"Got rid of Avast free computer virus and purchased based on reviews. So far, it runs in the background and has no annoying pop-ups that Avast had. I get it, you have a free anti-virus Avast and they have to get up to pay more for their services. I've had no issues and scan automatically upon start-up. I'm still running Windows 7 64-bit and works perfectly."
206296,1.0,2018,working
206297,1.0,2018,First I liked the price--upgraded to best package for a lot less than webroot would renew the package I had been using.  Webroot offended me with their aggressive renew threats where they tried to force me to renew or uninstall before my subscription was out.  It was relatively easy to uninstall and install new program on win7 and even easier on win10.
206298,1.0,2018,Webroot and a little common sense has kept me out of a lot of trouble. Non-bloated and doesn't slow my machine down as much as some other products have in the past.
206299,1.0,2018,Have used in past -- it works -- minimal overhead
206300,1.0,2018,Working fine for 2 months
206301,1.0,2018,Have been getting this product for several years now and am totally satisfied.  Easy to install and use.  Have experienced none of the problems I had with McAfee and Norton.
206302,-1.0,2018,it does not work.
206303,1.0,2018,"I hope it's as hard for others to get into as it was for me.  I downloaded the trial, liked it so bought this.  It installed easily and scanned fairly quickly, then sent me to website to register and create account.  It was picky about combination of characters but finally accepted, sent email providing me with link to complete activation.  First it wouldn't accept answer to security question so I had to change it, then it wouldn't accept security code, had to get another email link, wouldn't accept password.  Keep in mind that I had written these all on a pad, was carefully typing one finger at a time and you can't see what is typed, just the little dots.  I've spent the whole afternoon, including going through every .... ah, you don't want to hear all this.  It's a good program, but you have to activate your account to add the other devices and so far I haven't been successful.  I would probably give it a 5 if I could solve this but I'm tempted to give it one star."
206324,0.0,2018,Does not work as expected with Apple products.
206325,1.0,2018,"Great product and fantastic seller.
I highly recommend seller."
206326,1.0,2018,Its one of the best AV I've used. Norton and McAfee are garbage and slow your system terribly; Kaspersky was my choice before Webroot and I immediately recognized significant performance gains using Webroot without a loss in system security after switching from Kaspersky. Kaspersky also STILL prompts with ads even on fully paid/licensed versions.
206327,-1.0,2018,Do not buy this. Its worse than what they claim to protect from.
206328,1.0,2018,Fantastic product. 20 plus years in industry and really haven't seen much that compares.
207744,-1.0,2018,I don't really know how well it handles Internet security but ever since I got it my laptop keeps crashing when I'm on the Internet and it never did  before. Not looking forward to having to buy another program but I'm getting tired of the constant crashes.
207745,1.0,2018,Ease of installation
207746,1.0,2018,Recommended by my sister & also B- Buy.  It doesnt seem to be intrusive like many other systems but protects my computers & Apple products. Highly recommend.
207747,-1.0,2018,still have it & it would not download. Geeks had to take over.
207748,1.0,2018,It was recommended by my computer fixer guru and has worked well for me.
207749,0.0,2018,"Easy to install on my PC's. It is slowing my web browser a little. Used this to replace my G-Data Internet Security Suite when the license expired. Update 6/16: Never had a problem before, but I am now experiencing crashing of multiple websites as I browse. Pages freeze up then reload. Uninstalled  Webroot then reinstalled it and the problem cleared up BUT then reappeared."
207750,1.0,2018,works great.  no complaints
207751,1.0,2018,Best antimalware product available and easiest to install and operate.  If you're going to spend money on this kind of software Webroot is the one to buy.
207752,1.0,2018,easy to install works very well
207753,1.0,2018,My third year for using this product-so far so good.
207754,1.0,2018,"Since I started using Webroot Antivirus Internet Security , this has been a wonderful protection for my computer. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
207755,1.0,2018,I am very impressed with this product. I have used two other brands and was always frustrated by how much they bogged down my computer. Webroot doesn't interfere with my computer's processing speed at all and it is very user friendly. I highly recommend this product!
207756,1.0,2018,"Excellent software, I can't recommend this enough. However the price seems high. This is higher than on the Webroot website directly. I would recommend to buy it, though look around because you usually can find a better price than this."
207757,0.0,2018,"Can someone tell me if this WebRoot Internet Security DVD is 2017 or 2018?  There is no date on the package.  If you look at the bottom of the disk, the Reserved Rights is dated 2017.  Confused!"
207758,1.0,2018,Good Product but it only is good for one year.
207759,1.0,2018,This software has served my purposes well (over several years) on both MACs and PCs.
207760,1.0,2018,Good antivirus
207761,1.0,2018,I think it works.
207762,1.0,2018,"Great price, good product, easy to install."
207763,-1.0,2018,"I am not sureness if this is protecting my laptop or not, it SAYS its scanning, no virus yet, when I check my downloads, my security, it does NOT show this Webroot! Ive ATTEMPTED to get ahold of customer service, yet NO ONE has gotten back with me! My laptop is still extremely SLOW and its practically brand new and BARELY used!"
207764,1.0,2018,Fast and secure.
207765,1.0,2018,I pick this because it compatible with my MacBook Pro
207766,1.0,2018,Very goodgood
207767,1.0,2018,"tried other antivirus software, Norton & McAfee, had problems through email.  Kaspersky was the 2nd best, but WebRoot still the better of all I tried."
207768,1.0,2018,So far this seems to be providing great protection.
207769,-1.0,2018,"Error with installation resulted in needing to restore system, two days of trying to recover internet access and still not fully restored other programs affected by the failure of this program.  It's hard to get support help if you can't access email account."
207771,1.0,2018,I've previously only used free virus protection and it was slowing my computer down like crazy. This was inexpensive and it's great virus protection without all the issues you get from the free ones like Avast. It works like a dream and is easy to use. It's worth the investment!!
207772,1.0,2018,very good protection
207773,1.0,2018,Better than others we've had.  Fast start up.  Like the interface.
207785,0.0,2018,doesn't work like it said
207787,1.0,2018,Nothing is better than Webroot.
207788,1.0,2018,"Effective, automated, clear reporting."
207789,1.0,2018,Great security. Has picked up many problem emails while I am using it. Finds problems and cleans it up. Great product. Would tell my friends to buy it.
207790,1.0,2018,Has worked perfectly since installation. No issues. Like the low overhead on resources. Also the constant update of the threat library.
207791,1.0,2018,"""I love Webroot, it is very easy to use. I love that it updates in the cloud and I never have any interruptions or issues. The protection is good, I have never had any viruses or malware."
207792,1.0,2018,"I am very happy with Webroot and would recommend the product to anyone looking for internet security and improved PC performance. I previously used a top rated competitor's product and was disappointed because of all the unwanted """"byproducts"""" that greatly slowed down my laptop. Not so with Webroot. My computer is running more efficiently than ever, scans and updates happen in the background without interference. Very satisfied with my purchase."
207794,1.0,2018,Thank you.
207795,1.0,2018,"Works flawlessly in the background, good product!"
207796,-1.0,2018,"it does not work for me, it can""t work with the existing virus disk that is in my computer"
207797,1.0,2018,"Excellent product, easy to install and navigate..."
207798,1.0,2018,Received as promised and in new condition
207799,1.0,2018,"I like the fact that is was inexpensive and I don't do a lot of fancy stuff so hate the MaAfee/Norton nonsense which just dips deeper into your pocket. Kaspersky is a band of thieves. They stole money by invading my bank and did absolutely nothing good in the two years-plus I had it. Stinko!
Too bad ""government"" - everyone's - does not crack down on these thieves."
207800,1.0,2018,no muss - no fuss
207801,1.0,2018,"I like this brand.  It's easy to use.  It doesn't bog my computer down.  And since I started using it about 4 years ago, I've never had any virus problems (and I use the Internet every day).  It scans fairly quickly.  But, of course, the speed will depend on your individual computer.  Webroot works fine and intend to keep using it."
207802,-1.0,2018,"Surprised that this product is so well rated.
First, in order to buy a version that covers both PCs and Macs, I had to order a disk. Dumb! No one has DVD drives any more guys, so you need to wake up and change your technology. That's is so odd for a company that is supposed to be the best at security protection.
After I purchased the product. I was unable after 4 or 5 attempts to successfully register. The company seems to use the term password and security code interchangeably, which is absurdly confusing. Add to the complexity, they ask for only two of the letters rather than the whole password. But even then, I tried multiple times with the first password and the reset password and nothing worked. So then I submitted a trouble ticket, and of all the weird responses, they sent me an ID and password in open unencrypted email. Are you people serious?????

Guess I'll wait to see if this software works well after they help me register. But I am totally unimpressed so far. I just wanted to change to a US made security software because I don't trust the foreign software. But if you people don't have your act together, I guess I need to get a refund and go to PCMatic."
207803,-1.0,2018,"Windows 8. After install it ran an initial scan and when it finished, the program kept looping back to the initial scan......until I cancelled the scan. Then Firefox didn't work (""New Tab"") appeared whenever I typed in an address or clicked a bookmark. No printers worked including PDF and QuickBooks PDF even though all were installed and I couldn't re-install any.
I restored the system point I created prior to installing Webroot and everything was fine. After re-installing Webroot, all problems re-appeared when I rebooted and I'm writing this review."
207804,1.0,2018,I've been buying Webroot for many years.
207805,1.0,2018,works great. Doesn't done the computer.
207806,1.0,2018,"Have used Webroot for years, love it."
207807,1.0,2018,Simple fast works well.  Once it cleared up something Bitdefender couldn't do.  Since then I switched.
207808,-1.0,2018,"I don't see why this has such good reviews, at least based on the experience I've had with it. It's been OK on my Vista 64-bit machine and my Galaxy S5, but it made my VPN software (VyprVPN) to quit working and recently caused the latest release of Firefox to freeze on my Win 7 64-bit machine. I took it out and put Kaspersky Anti-Virus on the 7 machine and everything works fine. I had Kaspersky Internet Security for a year, but decided to try Webroot because of it's reviews, but I'm rather disappointed with Webroot. Maybe it works better on Win 10."
207809,1.0,2018,"Easy to install on pc, mac, and mobile phone. I switched because of the rising cost of security program I had used for 4 years."
207810,1.0,2018,never would buy any other internet security easy to install and works great
207811,1.0,2018,"Does the job, more affordable than the top tiers."
207812,1.0,2018,"Webroot always works well! In fact, I can tell a major difference when the subscription has run out. My computer is always so much slower when not using Webroot."
207824,0.0,2018,It's ok for my computer. But for my tablet and phone I do not know if it is actually protecting them. The scan only takes a few seconds verses an hour or so for the computer.
207825,1.0,2018,"Works very well, never interferes with regular use of computer or phone and does not slow down games or other software or apps. I feel it is securely monitoring and protecting behind the scenes.  Very happy with this software!"
207826,1.0,2018,Perfect
207827,1.0,2018,***** this is the only protection that I ever bought and don't regret
207828,-1.0,2018,Delivered on time excellent packaging. The Webroot software is letting a viruses attack my computer. I have used Webroot for 6-7 years but it has gotten worse. This will be my time I last purchase it.
207829,1.0,2018,Put it right to work.
207830,1.0,2018,"I feel safer with Webroot.  instead of renewing from last year, I purchased new disk at cheaper price on Amazon."
209074,1.0,2018,Great
209075,-1.0,2018,"It was an ok computer for a while, but it has been failing for a while. It is extremely inhibiting to have a Chrome only computer, but even worse if the computer blacks out on the screen. It has also always made really high pitch noises."
209076,1.0,2018,Very fast shipping exactly has described!!!!
209077,-1.0,2018,I did not order this so I don't know anything about it.  V
226541,1.0,2018,Works great !!
226542,1.0,2018,I have been using webroot for 4 years with no problems whatsoever.
226543,1.0,2018,Very nice product
226544,1.0,2018,It's kept me virus free. I love how low-key it is. I don't even know when it's updating
226546,1.0,2018,one of best anitvirus programs around. does not slow down your system. it can be accessed from anywhere. easy to install. it immediately shuts down any kind of threat. I love it
226547,0.0,2018,It works as posted
226548,1.0,2018,works good
226549,-1.0,2018,It would not update until I manually entered the code in place of the previous year.  Now it claims it will not update until I register.  Seems like a ploy and I will never order it again!!
226550,1.0,2018,Installs easily seems to be doing it's job
226561,1.0,2018,"Easy to install, and doing what it says it would!"
226562,-1.0,2018,"I bought this product december 20 2017 and they are telling me that my subscription has expired, and it hasn't even been a year. Highly disappointed"
226563,1.0,2018,Super easy to easy and very quick download. I have been using this product for years and this year (I don't know why) I decided to try AVG. I purchased the program and downloaded the program - it was a complete disaster and crippled my computer. I had to uninstall it in safe mode. I immediately went back to Webroot and I will not switch again. I would recommend this product without reservation.
226565,1.0,2018,Low CPU overhead and very good at finding malware.
226566,1.0,2018,"great product, easy download and easy install, recommend it"
226567,-1.0,2018,"I initially had issues w/the chat person - this should have been my first clue. It was supposed to be a certain price, but the link he sent for my checkout cart was almost twice that amount. Chatted w/another person and they got the cart link correctly. Then when I tried to register and input my password - with a confirmation box of my password - it kept saying my passwords didn't match. I did this SIX times and knew I had input the SAME password (using copy & paste), but no luck. Extremely frustrating which made me doubt their software ""protection"" since simply registering was such a fiasco. Then tried to follow their inadequate/confusing instructions for protecting my iPhone. My phone is still not protected and I'm an unhappy customer.
ps Webroot contacted me directly and ask for my input.  I sent them what I've said here.  They replied back stating my review did not meet their guidelines for posting on their site since it mentioned customer service issues.  What?!  Shouldn't a company be graded on their product AND their customer service?  Apparently they'll only allow positive comments on their website."
226568,1.0,2018,This is an excellent product. I was looking for an antivirus for my new computer and WebRoot came highly recommended and I see why. Internet Security Plus keeps me away from places I don't need to go. It works seamless and works in the background with no hit to performance. Thanks for a great product!
226569,1.0,2018,So far it has met my expections
226570,-1.0,2018,"This won't work on my mac, even though it said it would on the product description ."

226593,1.0,2018,Webroot does the job for me
226594,-1.0,2018,"Every time I end up using this product, it some how deletes some important files that are need for the start up of the computer and then I would have to re install windows. I tried one time when I got a free copy from best buy along with some purchase... and secondly I purchased this from Amazon. Both time same issue, I had to re install windows."
226595,-1.0,2018,This product is non-transferable.  I had to get a new laptop a few months after installing Webroot.  I've basically thrown my money away.
226596,1.0,2018,Good so far
226597,1.0,2018,"had on my desktop, laptop, an phone. no worries."
226598,1.0,2018,"Works wireless as well as wired, which I love. Connected great with Android phone after download of iMegacam but be sure to have phone close to camera during setup for quicker connect. I purchased for use as a security for my home. Would purchase again if another is needed. I love the fact I can use it with my smart phone.

This was a waste of money and I had to order Norton anyway. I need my money back. It stop working and everyone knew my business, I had to order Norton."
226600,1.0,2018,Always was a norton fan. But norton always seems to slow down my computers. This one doesnt and does a quality job
226601,1.0,2018,I like Webroot a lot.  I feel that is adequately protects me from internet hackers.  I have had no issues with online security since purchasing Webroot.
226602,0.0,2018,"Save your money, buy AVG, this is just letting way too much spam into my inbox."
226603,1.0,2018,I am pleased with the product and the service
226604,1.0,2018,When opening computer after installation; there is a right lower corner with the info of effectiveness w/o having to open several pages.
226605,-1.0,2018,"it was advertised as Webroot Internet Security Plus 2018 and Amazon choice.  when I purchased it, it shows as Webroot Internet Security Plus 2016 and doesn't show it works for Windows 10.  I am hoping it will still work on my Windows 10 computer.  SUPER MISLEADING!"
226606,1.0,2018,It seems to being it's job keeping my computer safe.
226607,-1.0,2018,Good software when it loads.  Mine didn't.
226608,1.0,2018,Great protection easy to use
226609,-1.0,2018,installed the software and ended up with a virus the very next day....worthless waste of money
226610,1.0,2018,Webroot  Internet Security Plus Antivisus 2018 works well as always. One of the best products out there. Great price for 1 yr. Have used Webroot for several years and love the product. Highly recommended!
226612,1.0,2018,Best anti virus software I've used to date. After getting it I have had no problems with any viruses. As a hardcore gamer it also doesn't cause me any issues with performance. Tech support is great as well they will go the extra mile to try and help..
226613,1.0,2018,Does everything I want it to do.
226614,-1.0,2018,Way too complicated
226615,1.0,2018,"Was advised to uninstall Kaspersky  due to security concerns.  Had Webroot on my PC and loved it so I added iff to my phone, tablet and laptop."
226616,-1.0,2018,one big hassle to download  it  use to be simple copy and paste the key code  now its a new procedure and its a pain  ive tried  a dozen times and im still fighting with it  . im just gona use another product

226931,-1.0,2018,I hate this product.  It was a waste of my money. It's like I don't have anything on my computer.
226933,1.0,2018,"Easy to install, easy to use."
226934,1.0,2018,"This is one of the only three virus programs I use or recommend.  I used this one for a few years straight and it works perfectly.  I have not been infected by any virus, root kit, or any malicious program.  I will use this program as long as it weeks performing the same, and that seems to be for a long time to come."
226935,1.0,2018,Seems to work fine
226936,1.0,2018,I've used Webroot for years now and always purchase here for far less than the renewal rate. If you're used to the other sloooowww antivirus software Webroot will amaze you.
226937,1.0,2018,great price
226938,1.0,2018,"Great product, works in the background with without constant reminders."

226941,1.0,2018,"Works great. Quick and easy installation. No headaches, signups are quick as well. Love it. Great price!"
226943,1.0,2018,Good for price
226944,-1.0,2018,"I am so incredibly frustrated by this product!  The installation process is a never ending cycle of passwords that don't work, keycodes that are ""already registered"", and screens that show you have no protection.  I can't believe I wasted my money on this.  Amazon, HELP!"
226945,1.0,2018,I like it. It is economic and it works just fine.
226946,-1.0,2018,After the program didn't work the techs wanted to push a $295 computer cleaning.  I had it done locally for $40 and still can't use the webriit.  Save your money!
226947,1.0,2018,"I'm giving 4stars although that is a tentative rating based on my previous Webroot install. I just (re)installed on my Windows 7 PC with no issue.  Shows as v. 9.0.20.31.  So far Webroot has given me no problems but  I just read the 1-star reviews and am now keeping my fingers crossed because some of thoe 1-star review claim that a once good product has been stripped of its value.
I had installled Webrooot Secure anywhere last year.  It seemed to protect me although I had not way to verify that it got all the malware.  Last year's installl never got in my way until my 1-year subscription expired.  Then it turned into nagware.  Constant popus nagging me to renewal and they wanted $80 for a subsription renewal.  Purchasing the product all over again at Amazon cost me only 25% of the ""annual renewal"" price.  Their policy apparently is to sell the initial install cheap and then gouge like crazy on the renewal price.
I just purchased this version from Amazon.  I had to uninstall the previous Webroot app to install the newly purhased app., which I did thru the ""programs"" tab on the Windows control center.  Once I did that, the new install was simple.  There are a number of 1-star reviews with horror stories about installing this program but for me it was straightforward.  When I purchsed from Amazon I was provided a keycode and all I had to do was provide the keycode at the start of the install process after downloading the install file from the Amazon software center.  I'm running Windows 7.  It's possible the horror stories are real but are based on a different version of Windows. Future reviewers should state which Windows version they are running."
226948,1.0,2018,"Little impact on system resources, minimal interface, great product.

Con:  You can buy 3 new license for $19 or renew the currently installed single license for $40....  Just purchase 3 new license, uninstall, reinstall!"
226970,1.0,2018,Excellent app. Solved many issues.
226971,-1.0,2018,"This is said to be a non-refundable product. I have a MacBook that needs anti-virus protection so I was trying to make sure that this would work with my MacBook. It says ""For PC and Mac"" right on the box! It says ""#1 Rated Best Seller for Mac"" right under all the Windows PC's it also works for. Now I'm finding out that this WILL NOT work with my Mac. THIS IS VERY MISLEADING ADVERTISING! Somewhere in the write up it should say ""If you are buying this for a Mac then you need to buy our Mac Version, not this one!"" My God, they didn't mail me a CD, it's all digital, just give me the digits for a Mac instead! I buy thousands of dollars worth of items from Amazon every year so I am very surprised by this false advertising. When I called Webroot for help to get this downloaded onto my Mac they explained the problem then proceeded to try to sell me a program costing $299 a year for ultimate Mac protection. When I said no he immediately dropped it to $199. I told him forget it, I'd rather buy a new MacBook."
226972,-1.0,2018,"I am trying to download product no such luck. I had loaded this and my computer went bad, now I cannot get holdof theowner who sold the product to rest my code so I can reload on new computer. The download counted for items I have not used, now my new omputer for my work I need protected is not loading, I am pissed. Never buy a product that has a product key on the web, make them send a hard opy this way u do not get screwed"
226973,-1.0,2018,"theres some sort of virus that when i redirect, an ad comes up, you close it, and proceed. ad blocker is turned on. another message comes up at times that says ""warning....Microsoft has detected a virus on your computer.....have to logoff internet and get back on to continue.
the scan is so fast, that I'm not sure its effective. never found anything....ever. probably would be more impressed if it found something."
226974,-1.0,2018,"Webroot is nothing but a phishing scam. Do NOT purchase as it will not allow you to activate without a lot of personal information. They're scam is to drag you through a ridiculously complicated activation process that never activates without disclosure of again a lot of unnecessary personal info.
I am currently trying to get a refund from Amazon with no luck. Bad, bad product."
226975,1.0,2018,Greatest antivirus protection anywhere. Wouldn't use anything else.
226976,1.0,2018,"I have no problems with the software and it does not let anything into my computers and tablets. I use it on a dell and toshiba computer, I
also use it on my kindle tablet."

226978,1.0,2018,"GOod antivirus, very fast."

226983,-1.0,2018,"I got this and while I was clicking I wasn't sure how it was going to download without any problems.  I've tried several times, and contacted the webroot customer service group and they provided me with absolutely no help.  I am in the process of getting amazon to cancel this asap, unfortunately amazon does not provide a cancel button like all other orders, not  a good thing for customers!!!

eses"
226984,1.0,2018,Been using this for some time now and have had no issues. Works well and does not interfere with anything else.

227000,-1.0,2018,Does not seem to be an active antivirus
227001,-1.0,2018,JUNK
227002,1.0,2018,Works like it is not there and doesn't appear to slow speeds.  Have not had issues.  Not sure how well it is working though have not had any issues in a couple months either so we are happy.
227003,1.0,2018,"Works well! I had webroot on my computer when I first bought it new but the subscription ran out so I went looking for a new one. This one was fantastic! Saw it in the stores for $50+, so I was happy when I found this here. Plus there is no wait time because you get sent an email and can download it right away. :)"
227004,-1.0,2018,"After installation I rebooted the computer, the computer never came back up."
227005,1.0,2018,love it thanks.
227006,1.0,2018,is very good antivirus for its price. I would recommend it.
227007,1.0,2018,Work's great thus far for the low price. Has great online reviews
227008,1.0,2018,"I've had this program for about three weeks now; super light on the computer's memory usage, scans in a minute plus, protects identity, firewall, has utilities you can mess with, and has a little community option.  I have a 1TB 6B RAM Lenovo and the software has done me well."
227009,1.0,2018,Great price and product.
227010,-1.0,2018,You have to link each computer to your Amazon account before installing software.
227012,1.0,2018,"I love Webroot, it doesn't slow the computer and I've never gotten any virus's using it."
227013,1.0,2018,"Excellent antivirus program that never noticeably taxes my computers resources.  My last antivirus program was AVG Free, which turned into a virus-like program after Avast took over.  I've been using Webroot for nearly a year now.  It's definitely worth the price."
227014,1.0,2018,"Webroot is always my fav antivirus, 3 years so far. You can't beat the price and none of my 3 devices have had any issues with viruses getting through. Thankful for this software, it works great!"
227015,1.0,2018,I love Webroot. I've been using it for years and it has kept me secure and in Peace.
227016,0.0,2018,"Had some weird pop up thing come through which was yelling at me that I had a virus. I knew it wasn't true, but I would have thought this software would have stopped it.  I wasn't even using a browser or looking at emails when it came through."
227017,1.0,2018,I have only had it for a short period of time.  I like it so far.
227018,-1.0,2018,Webroot said this could not be downloaded and wanted to  charge me $99 to install it. This is a fraud.  I want a refund
227040,1.0,2018,Must have Hands down
227041,-1.0,2018,"I purchased Webroot because it was very well reviewed, and I had been having problems running games with Avast.  It turns out Webroot is as bad, if not worse, than Avast in that regard.  The installation went fine, and very quickly.  But I could not use ANY Origin game with it installed.  I tried several different methods of allowing the games to run from the settings in Webroot, then disabled it entirely.  They would not work until I completely uninstalled the software.  It was a complete waste of time, and money.  Learn from my mistake."
227042,1.0,2018,Easy to install and use. Doesn't slow the computer down. No issues.
227043,-1.0,2018,This product wouldn't download.
227044,1.0,2018,Great low price download. Protects my HP Omen PC and I will also use it on my Toshiba laptop.
227045,1.0,2018,"I have been using it for more than 10 years; no false positives, fast & unobtrusive, kind of pricey if not bought at a sizeable discount (Amazon)."
227046,1.0,2018,"Bought it after ""free edition AVG anti-virus""  missed some annoying virus that kept redirecting my browser to a malignant website.
Webroot got rid of it during the installation process. Its a very light software, doesn't use much resources, and loads before the rest of the programs."
227047,-1.0,2018,IT DIDN'T WORK
227048,1.0,2018,very nicely priced
227049,1.0,2018,I did as another reviewer suggested copy and pasted the product key into the product key space in web root account and done. Easiest process I've ever had. Thanks

227067,-1.0,2018,I have malware on my computer and purchased this product to get rid of it and it did nothing. it just told me that I do not have a virus when it is clearly present on my computer. I wish I could return this.
227068,1.0,2018,cheap and works well
227069,1.0,2018,Best way to purchase antivirus..its all online based so doesn't slow down your computer and can find more issues that normal antivirus. Look online for a rebate there's tons on this software. Don't pay retail.

227077,1.0,2018,"Nice and simple install, before on my laptop i couldn't even go on the internet without a pop up coming up or freezing on me every couple minutes. but after the install it removed the viruses i had and now it feels like a brand new laptop. Reccomend it to anyone"
227078,1.0,2018,Seems to work quite well.
227090,0.0,2018,"Like the product, can't figure out how to stop all the annoying notifications."
227091,-1.0,2018,"Was using Kaspersky and thought I would take a chance on this because it was cheaper. The day after install and computer reboot, Windows 10 won't connect to the internet. I couldn't login to my account because of this issue. I want my money back for the product. I had to do a computer restore to get my computer working again. Horrible product and only purchased two days ago."

227120,-1.0,2018,My computer ran slowly and eventually. Dumped this and installed Norton and computer back to normal. Would like a refund.
227121,1.0,2018,Webroot is a solid Antivirus tool and it is probably the most efficient I have come across. Takes up no space at all...
227122,-1.0,2018,Cancel
227123,-1.0,2018,"When purchasing the title states this is the newest 2018 version, but once purchased you receive the outdated 2016 version."
227124,-1.0,2018,Webroot Internet Security Antivirus 2018 disables Internet Explorer. Please give me back my money.
227125,1.0,2018,I liked the price I paid for this item. A lot cheaper than the store. The only thing I didn't like was the ease of installing. I finally figured out I had to uninstall my old expired version before this one would work...
227126,1.0,2018,Works well!
227127,-1.0,2018,"When I went to download this, it completely loaded my computer with viruses and prevented me from getting Webroot. It gave me a product key and charged my credit card $19.24 (including tax) but I received absolutely nothing for it. I gave up on trying to get Webroot from Amazon and decided to get it from the link from PC Magazine. From there it cost me an additional $18, but it downloaded perfectly without viruses and when it did so it removed the viruses that this site put on my computer. I positively love Webroot. Best antivirus software I ever had. It's just too bad that this site is a total RIP-OFF! Do NOT try to get Webroot from this site at all. WARNING!!!!"
227340,-1.0,2018,Software is not working? Need a refund!
227341,-1.0,2018,This version does not support High Sierra. I would like a refund.

227344,-1.0,2018,I have downloaded this numerous times and cannot open the application on my Mac.  Don't buy this product!!
227919,1.0,2018,Been using it for years. No issues
227920,1.0,2018,Webroot is awesome. Doesn't get in your way unless you need to check something. Highly recommend
227922,1.0,2018,"Bar none, this is the best security program for laptop, notebooks, and mobiles. No interference with any other Mainstay applications like other security software programs"
227924,1.0,2018,I have had any issues since I've switched over to this. My computer does accumulate browsing cookies but a quick scan fixes that.
227925,1.0,2018,"So far, so good. Works well, I just renewed for another year.
No computer problems so far."
227926,1.0,2018,:)
227928,1.0,2018,Have only had protection for 2 Mos. so far no peoblems
227950,-1.0,2018,"After downloading and following the Webroot site instructions to manually remove the previous version, my laptop crashed and has not functioned since. I tried to contact Webroot multiple times for tech asst and received generic answers to FAQs. Its bad enough that the software didn't work, and that it destroyed my laptop, but then I couldn't even get a refund. Unbelievable."
227951,1.0,2018,"I have been using this program for YEARS.  Buying direct from Amazon for great savings.  Last year, the program ""caught"" a ransomware hijack immediately.  I also like that it barely affects computer resources and scans are very fast."
227952,-1.0,2018,"I purchased directly from Webroot.  I know better but I fell for the PC Mag review (their reviews have become notoriously unreliable).  There are lots of reasons I have uninstalled it and gotten a refund (to Webroot's credit).  I will share a few:

1)  I read the T&C carefully and thoroughly.  They share your personal info, browsing history, etc. with third-parties (undisclosed names), and also obtain personal information from third parties that they combine with that they have already.  How does this protect me?  They won't say.  They just said this:  Our legal team provided the following: ""Webroot requires certain permissions from your devices and collects information about you to provide you with our security services and to let you know about related Webroot security products you might be interested in.""  They can track literally everything you do, every program or app you run (and when), every document you edit, every email, and store that information in their servers.  Isn't that what spyware does.

2) WebRoot hasn't been included in independent testing for a number of years (I can't remember, but about 5).  When I asked why not, this was their response:  ""As far as our participation in AV-Comparatives or AV-Test.org, we have participated in the past. The status of our current participation will likely depend on how cloud security solution providers are tested vs. traditional security solutions. Since the approach to protecting from malware is different, the testing would need to be different to capture real world scenarios effectively. ""  There are a few other cloud-based offerings out there.  It's been years, so I would think that if there was a real will to do so, there would be a testing regimen.  Seems the easiest is to test actual infections and see what gets caught.  That's what the others do.  Isn't that the point of installing this anyway?

3) Webroot discovered one infected file when I installed it and did the initial scan.  IT was one I had written and compiled myself (an EXE)!  It couldn't possibly be infected.  It didn't flag a nearly identical file in the same directory.  Then I executed that (second) file and Webroot flagged it.  Again, that was one I had written and compiled myself.  Two other AV-AM programs ignored it.

4) Webroot brags that it can scan your system in 20 seconds, for which other security software takes about 10 minutes (depending on your CPU speed, size of hard disk, etc.) to do.  Whatever they did in those 20 seconds was nonsense.  My files weren't and aren't infected.  I have since rolled-back my PC's to pre-Webroot and installed other security software that I am confident works (It's not Kaspersky or BitDefender- both highly rated but, to me, equally as security-compromised as Webroot because of their home-nations).

5) I asked support what happens when I uninstall Webroot:  ""Yes, it should remove all traces of the product. If you want to be sure it is completely removed, you can run through the instructions for using the uninstall command below to be sure. ""  (Fortunately I image my PCs every night with Macrium), so I just rolled back to before I installed Webroot obviating the need to uninstall it.  However I did try to uninstall it from one machine before I did that.  It seems to have silently reinstalled itself, because it showed up in Windows Control Panel ""Programs and Features"" again, and had an icon in the system tray again.  Creepy.

6) My conclusion is that Webroot is no better than spyware.  Except that most spyware is free.  I am just glad that Webroot doesn't have my (current) passwords.

My advice is to avoid Webroot.  And avoid taking PC Mag reviews seriously."
227953,1.0,2018,Very happy with this product. Have used it for the past 3 years after leaving McAfee. It has much quicker scanning and I have not had to worry about viruses at all. I use it to protect 4 different family computers and the price is great.
227954,0.0,2018,"This thing worked great once and once only -- I don't get it.  It always has ""20 removed viruses.""  Never any more and always says the same thing.  Waste of my time and money at this point.  But it came highly recommended by a computer guy."
227955,1.0,2018,Down loading the program was a problem until i found the tiny icon ment for it. It could have been better explained.
227956,-1.0,2018,"I spent 55minutes with four technicians to get a download of this product to my phone. I received error messages specifying that File sharing is not supported: Your navigator doesn't support a file sharing functionality. Connect a compatible navigator to share the file. No where on the web page does it say to go to the Google Store to get the download. These technicians sent me download links from Amazon and none worked properly for smartphones. I called the phone number for WebRoot and they told me to download the app from Google Store. The misrepresentation is horrific and each technician gave me all wrong answers. I was on the phone for 50 minutes with Amazon. I spoke a supervisor, her callous tone was disgraceful. She didn't have the decency in apologizing for the workers that she trains."
227957,1.0,2018,"does its job,worked so far"
227958,1.0,2018,So far I love this. I haven't had any problems yet. I would recommend it to friends and family as of right now. I haven't had it for long though. It was easy to install( walks you through it).
227969,1.0,2018,"I've used Webroot for about eight weeks now and have had no issues. It installed easily and promptly and has not caused any interference with other applications on my Windows 10 desktop or laptop or on my old Vista PC. It does all its work in the background without calling attention to itself, which is what I like. I can't comment on how well it is protecting my computers other than to say that I have perceived no threats or disruptions since installing it, which means either that there haven't been any or that Webroot is doing its job. I strongly recommend this product."
227970,-1.0,2018,Do not download if you are purchasing for an iPad or iPhone.  Amazon downloads work for windows only.  I just wasted my money. It doesnt even rate 1 star.
227971,1.0,2018,"Best antivir i used in my company. The identity protection option sometimes ruins webforms though, be careful. Especially if you are working with barcodes!"
227972,1.0,2018,"I've been using this for awhile, and am very pleased with it not having to download data updates everyday (like Windows Defender use to, which is what I used before). When it spots something suspicious, I also like the simple pop-up alert and response options. And as far as I can tell, it doesn't slow down my computer at all, whether it's installing a new program or browsing the web."
227973,1.0,2018,"Installation was easy, and it seems to be working.  However, I downgraded it a bit because when I use it with Microsoft Explorer as the browser, it disables the back button on eBay when I select to view an item  offered by eBay as a complement to an item that fits my search criteria. That means that I have to exist eBay and log in again, to get on with my viewing.  This was so frustrating that I gave up my eBay browser, and made Chrome my default browser.  So far, I haven't had any problems using Chrome as the broser."
227974,1.0,2018,Love it it has already identified a virus on a website I had always thought was safe.
227975,1.0,2018,"I find this to be one of the best and easiest anti virus softwares programs as it operates in the background as you work, and takes up minimal memory. For some reason or other though Ive been unable to use the password manager. Ive used this previously and it was a great password manager. I used the password I set but it didn't recognize the person. So I reset it, and seconds after resetting it I tried again and it still didn't recognize the person. Ive done that a few times to no avail."
227977,1.0,2018,Download easy works great
227978,1.0,2018,This is a great product that even novice users will find easy to install and use. I use it to protect all of our family's PCs.
227990,1.0,2018,Glad webroot lets me enter code and not have to load anything!
227991,1.0,2018,"I have had Webroot AV for years, the protection is awesome and the other features they don't talk about much. I think its well worth the price to keep your mind at ease when surfing."
227992,-1.0,2018,"It may be a good protector, but I have limited vision and the print onscreen is so tiny.

It is letters on a dark background making it that much harder.

Probably designed by kids with excellent vision.  Ha Ha.

Then sign in sure didn't instill confidence."
227993,1.0,2018,So far so good. This is considered one of the best antivirus softwares.
227994,1.0,2018,Great web security
227996,1.0,2018,Works great in the background.  Amazing software
227997,1.0,2018,"I still like it after two months. So far so good. It throws up about as many blacks and notifications as does Malware-bytes. Easy install, easy updates, easy running scans. I also use premium Malwarebytes and as far as I can tell both products do NOT interfere with each other.

I got this after a little bit of googling and reviews. I needed to ditch Symantec Norton because those commies broke relationship with NRA. If you don't support my 2A then I don't support you. This product is a good replacement for Symantec/Norton."
227998,1.0,2018,Works perfect and does not slow down the computer or give annoying messages.
228009,1.0,2018,"Easy to download. Takes up little space. Works in the background as you complete other tasks. Automatic scans and updates while you are working..Reasonably priced. Works well with Windows Vista, Windows 7, 8 & 10. Also works well on my android phone and tablet. Very fast scans. Was recommended by my bank. Very pleased with it. Protects you while on the Internet as well as your files and passwords. I chose this over Norton, McAfee, and Vipre."
228012,1.0,2018,still working
228013,1.0,2018,Very good protection for my 4 coputer
228014,1.0,2018,WORKS GREAT
228015,1.0,2018,I love this new internet security. For several decades I've been a loyal AVG user and they did a good job. But they seem to think that they can invade my privacy with constant daily annoying pop-up ads to buy more of their products. And of course this usually happens when I'm in a pitched battle fighting for my avatar's survival in a MMO game. I checked all the other security services and finally found one that didn't do popups. It's just a little more expensive and worth every penny. By the way it does a great job of protecting me from all those bad things on the internet.
228016,1.0,2018,Great protection
228018,-1.0,2018,"I downloaded it to fix my laptop for any viruses, and it wouldn't let me renew it. I have already a antivirus of webroot in my PC and when I tried to renew the program so that my laptop can be safe from viruses, it wouldn't let me and I purchased it for no reason. So it was a waste of time for me to buy this."
228039,-1.0,2018,"Since I installed Webroot on my computer, it has been acting crazy, for having a small footprint supposedly, my computer is really acting strange."
228040,1.0,2018,LOVE IT!!!!!!
228041,1.0,2018,provides peace and security while I use my computer.
228042,1.0,2018,"After trying multiple anti virus software over the years, I've always found Webroot to be the most reliable with the best interface.  Definite recommend and the digital download is very convenient."
228043,1.0,2018,Never have to worry with Webroot.  Protects up to 5 devices... I only use 3. Great antivirus.
228044,1.0,2018,Webroot doesn't slow my computer down as other brands I have tried do. We have been using Webroot for 6 years now and have never had a problem. It's much cheaper buying from Amazon than renewing directly from Webroot.
228045,1.0,2018,"We have used Webroot complete for a few years now with no problems, and plan on staying with them unless something changes. The protection is almost seamless as to being noticed. Scans are smooth and not disruptive. So far, we have had no infections, but we try to be careful."
228046,-1.0,2018,I purchased the 5 license anti virus and it would only load on 1 computer. I Contacted Webroot who I have used for 5 years and they said they would not help me because they had no proof of purchase? Since I had loaded it on 1 computer and it accepted my key code i thought it was odd that they had no record of purchase but I canceled thru Amazon and went with someone else.
228047,1.0,2018,Does s good job
228048,1.0,2018,Good buy
228069,1.0,2018,WebRoot works great. I have been using it for about 3 years and it has keep me protected. It works in the back ground and I have not had any problem with the program.
228070,1.0,2018,Runs nicely in the background without tying up computer resources when scanning like our old antivirus (sometimes I forget it is even there). I especially like the website addon that tells you if web links are safe to click.
228071,1.0,2018,"I really like this program.  It has low impact on the system, and functions well.  We have used this for several years!"
228072,1.0,2018,"The product works well. Price right for services provided. Customer Service access is a bit sloppy, but if you're capable to known you nedd it and capable to install it. It's hard to figure, but they could do better here."
228073,1.0,2018,Have used Webroot for years with no problems at all. Will continue.
228074,1.0,2018,"This is the best anti-virus I've used.  It's user friendly.  Doesn't take a techy to install or use.  Mostly, once installed, it does it's thing.  I barely notice it's running but when I check to see if it's been scanning, it has.  I buy Webroot every year for my five machines."
228075,1.0,2018,I recommend it. I've been using this software 5 years in the roll. It works. It doesn't slow your computer or any other device that you installed it.
228076,1.0,2018,"simple, works well, quick, well pleased."
228077,0.0,2018,First time I tried it.
228078,0.0,2018,"No issues with the downloading of the product. Amazon did their part. Software does the job for extensive web surfing. However Webroot seems to raise and lower the price every other year. Starting with the 2017 product they now automatically enroll you in an automatic renewal of the product, and the price is sky high ($79.99). It's not listed in Webroot's initial terms of purchase. Have to opt out when you receive an email about renewing or you will pay 2 and half times what you paid for it from Amazon for 2018. They also now want you to give up your right to participate in a class action lawsuit which came about 8 moths after purchasing the product. Thus, Webroot had unpleasant surprises come up well after the purchase."
228079,-1.0,2018,Love the product buy ordered for 5 computes will only download on one
228080,1.0,2018,Needed to get away from Kaspersky.
228081,1.0,2018,"Best Antivirus on the market
Advantages
1. Doesn't take long to scan your entire hard drive
2. Doesn't take up a lot of space on your hard drive
3. GUI is user friendly
4. Web extension works great
5. Web portal allows you to have centralize control
6. Immediately removes threat and starts to scan the hard drive"
228082,1.0,2018,works good
228083,-1.0,2018,"WTH? I had 22 days left on last year's subscription. I put the new key in so I don't forget when the subscription expires thinking it would just add one year to my current subscription. It did not. It simply wiped out the remaining days I had left. WTH, Webroot? Why are you ripping off your customers?"
228085,1.0,2018,Great
228086,1.0,2018,Excellent software. My second installation.  Very easy just enter new product key into expired software account and activaste
232762,1.0,2018,Love it but cannot figure out unlimited service I was paying for a service I didn't see or understand I think I cancelled it!!!

232764,-1.0,2018,"I downloaded this app hoping it would be like or even close to Pandora....it's not. The radio stations are limited and play the same band over and over again, instead of the genre. I guess I will get my subscription of Pandora back."

232766,1.0,2018,Music
232767,-1.0,2018,This is app making system slow with constantly high CUP usage. Please fix it asap.
232768,1.0,2018,Thank you Amazon Prime. Was a member of prime for years b4 I even realized this was a part of my membership. I'll be looking into your new Unlimited program shortly. I like this 100% better than Pandora or Spotify. I'll be comparing Unlimited to Apple Music and the amount of devices that can be used without paying for expanded or family membership.
232769,1.0,2018,Great album!
232770,-1.0,2018,"there was weird lag, constant updates that make no sense, and the software wasn't even Apple-approved. I'm thrilled you're employing developers to support this application, but your website works just as well so it's kinda pointless because it is so crappy"
232771,1.0,2018,Running MacOS 10.13.5 on my new iMac and it works perfect.
232772,1.0,2018,It's a great app

232779,1.0,2018,Best streaming music software hands down.
232780,1.0,2018,Loving the music and it is easy to use.

232782,1.0,2018,great
232783,-1.0,2018,"Hasn't worked for a long time (like, years) and I'm uninstalling it.  It says it is starting, but then just disappears.  If this were mine, I'd remove it from the store.  I'd be too embarrassed to have my name against it."
232784,0.0,2018,don't use it much.  How is it different than Pandora or spotify.
232785,-1.0,2018,"Installs very slowly on my Mac running OS-X 10.12.4, then crashes with no error log (just closes itself). Very odd behavior. I suspect Amazon has given up on maintaining the desktop app. The issue was originally caused by the app trying to auto-update ""Microsoft-style"" without asking permission.

It's not an app I used much or will miss, but it's pretty sad when a company (well, its money) can launch space rockets but not write a simple app :-)"
232786,1.0,2018,Really enjoy this app.
232788,-1.0,2018,"I thought I signed up for a 30 day trial... now I can't figure out how to cancel, and the time is ticking down to... what was the price again. I am unhappy."

232790,1.0,2018,"This used to work great but does not work on my Mac anymore. I have a lot of albums plus Amazon Music, but this is now worthless when the app does NOT work!

232792,0.0,2018,Amended from original review. It works ok. I do not love the default to their Prime popular music. I will pretty much never like anything there. Wish My Music would be the default view.
232793,-1.0,2018,"I've downloaded this 3 times... everytime my MAC computer starts acting up and says ""run out of application memory""  Very frustrating!  Im paying to use this monthly and I had to delete the app to fix my computer."
232794,1.0,2018,"Great music.  I stream music all day and into the night.  I find everything I want to hear on Amazon Music.  One thing I wish was different is, for instance, if I select 60's music, it is the same format every day.  If I select this, I get the same music at the same time every day.  I made a playlist to avoid this - but it is nice to have the selections they offer.  I really like that they have a lot of obscure pieces - there is a lot of Van Morrison's early work, etc.  At night I can find fabulous operas (my parrots love to listen to opera)."
232795,1.0,2018,Wonderful Music Software. Have really enjoyed. Would love to have an Equalizer option
232796,1.0,2018,"Amazon Prime and music is a great fit, first thing in the office I crank up the music and get the set with some great music"
232797,1.0,2018,good

232810,-1.0,2018,Does not work with most recent Mac systems. Desperately needs to be updated to continue to be Mac compatible.  It cannot even open to run.
232811,1.0,2018,"Like it but unfortunately opens on my MacBook without asking, hmmmm."
232812,1.0,2018,"No more interruptions when listening to my favorite music!  I love the diverse genre choices and hard-to-find ""old school tunes to put you in the mood""!"
232813,1.0,2018,"Works great and is the only music I listen to now.  I can add songs to create playlists, find stations based off my preference, or search other playlists that match my taste."
232814,1.0,2018,"I am going to give this a qualified five star review, although I would give it about 4.5 if I could. It is vastly improved over the early product. It has numerous features that outshine the iTunes app, of course only in regards to music. Chief among these is the ability to replay your downloaded playlists on an iPhone or iPad indefinitely, a feature unavailable in iTunes. Unfortunately, when you download your playlists to a computer, the songs get transferred, not by playlist, but by artist. To the detriment of the Amazon app, Amazon is now closing down their 250,000 song feature for those who are willing to pay, like me. Amazon is now hyping their unlimited play plan which, I am profoundly sorry to say cannot compete with my eclectic tastes. The streaming of one artist I like, will not be available until December 31, 2039 according to her page. Many of the Jazz albums in my collection are simply unavailable, unless they access the ones I've uploaded. I am not and never will be a pop music fan...so bye bye when my contract runs out in October. Oh, iTunes gets a 3.9."
232815,1.0,2018,"Haven't had a chance to use this as much as I would like to but I love it.  I love music and making the selections of music

232818,1.0,2018,great music
232819,1.0,2018,Love the fact that I can download music and play it later without  having to use an Internet connection. The only problem is that a lot of the songs the songs/artists I that I'd like to use requires an Amazon Unlimited account. (I have Prime).
232820,-1.0,2018,"Badly written application. Amazon has billions of dollars in cash. Amazon: Consider paying a good software development team to make this app solid, just like iTunes, Rhapsody, or pretty much any music streaming app written by a large company. Catch up in quality.

232837,-1.0,2018,"So disappointed.  I have been using amazon music on my phone for a couple of years now, and up til now it has worked like a charm.  Used to be able to play music on my mac with this, but it is BROKEN!!!  I can't even get it to open after downloading the ""Mac"" version.  It used to be that when I would buy music from amazon, it would automatically pop the autorip window.  I had been using this instead of Apple's busted iTunes garbage.  But, since Apple screwed up my music library (with EVERY update), I completely stopped using iTunes.  FIX IT, AMAZON!!!!  This is ridiculous!"
232838,1.0,2018,Love it!
232839,1.0,2018,I really use amazon music. They have playlists that hit the spot for most times of day. Set and forget.

232842,0.0,2018,"The app itself is much like the one on iOS, so in that regard it's ""OK"" but I am not a fan of the UI. Half star off.

But a huge and annoying difference is that for some reason there is a long fade out at the end of most every song resulting in 5-15 seconds of silence (I often think the app froze or is waiting to buffer). I cannot find a fade adjustment or related setting for this, and I do not experience this under the iOS app, where songs move from one to the other in a timely fashion. To me it's distracting enough that I don't use the Mac version very often, and for that I dock another 1.5 stars"

232864,1.0,2018,Good mix of music available
232865,1.0,2018,I have been able to download hundreds of songs for no cost.
232866,-1.0,2018,"Remember when your entire music collection could be stored on a single device -- an iPod -- and clouds were what rain came out of?  Ever since iTunes shifted to wifi-based music, I've been looking for a workaround. I bought this because I wanted to be able to listen to my music when traveling by air, without having to connect to wifi. The ads said that one could transfer music from iTunes to Amazon Music, but this turns out not to be the case. You can, however, listen to the music you purchased on Amazon. But I bought most of my music thru iTunes because I wanted to play it when I'm actually moving around in the world. So I'm wondering why I would switch to Amazon Music? Does everything have to be proprietary now???"
232867,1.0,2018,great
232868,1.0,2018,Does what is expected

232874,1.0,2018,"The app looks great, sounds great and works great.  A no-brainier if you have amazon prime.  A great choice even if you don't."
232875,1.0,2018,"Free download and a GREAT alternative to iTunes!  I did not appreciate Apple iTunes erasing my downloaded CD library, leaving only what I purchased from them after I cancelled iTunes Match.  Amazon Music allows great flexibility so that can create playlists."
232876,-1.0,2018,"Horrible music app when playing via Bluetooth. Non-responsive to skip/pause/play commands from my car, barely works when using those features on the phone. Alexa only works sometimes. After about 3 or 4 skips the app locks up and has to be forced closed and restarted. Not something we should be focusing on while driving. This thing makes me want to throw my phone out the window. I wish a company as large as Amazon could fix something so simple. I love playing Amazon music on my Echo but hate playing it via my phone + Car - too bad I spend most of my time in the car."
232877,1.0,2018,I like this way better than Spotify. User friendly and it is not laggy. No commercials in between songs.
232878,1.0,2018,A very good app
232879,1.0,2018,I love it.
232881,1.0,2018,Love it. But why I couldn't download to my Mac.?
232882,-1.0,2018,music choice is no good but the software itself is ok
232883,1.0,2018,This is the best music streaming app that I've ever used.  It has every type of music preference you could think of without the annoying commercials.
232884,-1.0,2018,"Can't even fix a basic installer bug: no matter where it was previously installed, application updates always install on desktop. This is on a Mac. Macs install applications in the applications folder. They just do. My desktop is synced via iCloud, so updating an application that's on my desktop is just plain dangerous. It's also beyond arrogant of Amazon to think that I want this app on any desktop, let alone every desktop. I don't. I want it on the machine I installed it on, which is the one connected to the freaking speakers in my office. It is bad enough that it installs to a stupid place, but why does it insist on repeating that after every update when it's perfectly clear based on the location of the program that is being updated that I want it where I put it.

The review tips and guidance say:

""Do compare to similar products or services and share how long you've used this product.""

So here we go: it is the only piece of software on my Mac that does this, so by comparison it is the worst."
232885,1.0,2018,great

I gave the phone to my hubby who hung up on him. I finally  managed to get hold of someone at office 365 who was very nice and helped get it installed.

241405,-1.0,2018,"This is one of the worst products Microsoft ever made. I installed it on a new Windows 10 Desktop. It takes for ever to open a document in Word, Excel, and the other applications. When I try to open a document it takes 8 seconds or more to open, very slow. There are many complaints on the Internet and Microsoft will not fix the problem. Just Google Office 365 slow to open and read the complaints. There tech support can't fix the problem or they just don't know how to fix the problem. This has gone on for a long time. I am sorry I bought this product. Office 2007 and 2010 works somewhat. They open slow also and the work around is to activate preview pain to get it to open.

241410,0.0,2018,"For full disclosure, this came ""with"" the laptop I bought on a shopping network, although to my surprise it was only a one-month trial.  While that isn't Microsoft's fault and for the most part, the product is okay, it brings me to the subscription price which is ridiculously high.  After 3 years, you have really paid for what they used to charge for the same software, except they're still collecting subscription costs from you in year 4, year 5, year 6, etc. In other words, Microsoft has found new ways to make more money at their customers' expense in the name of Microsoft 365.  Additionally, this product often seems a half-second slow on many tasks, compared to older versions of Office.  There is often delays while the wheels are spinning and you're waiting for the program to respond.  And then there is those awful ""Microsoft Office is not responding"" messages which waste more of your time.  Sadly, I would like to compare it to similar products, but alas Microsoft has put everyone else out of business, so they're aren't similar products.  The product is okay, but Microsoft continues to become less user friendly with every new version they put out."

241431,0.0,2018,"""Upgraded"" from the 2010 version, mostly because I need the longlong variable in VBA.  Unfortunately doing math with the longlong variable gives unexpected results.  Apparently, rather than doing integer math they convert to floating point, which rounds up the results.  This results in a sticky lsb so that when dividing an odd number by 2 (to simulate a right shift, which they have omitted) you will then forever get an odd result, e.g. 9/2 = 5, rather than 4.  Also, it only keeps 7 significant bytes, not the advertised 8.  I really needed 8.  Also, if you do a copy and paste, and then later try to insert a new row by clicking on ""insert"" it does strange things rather than inserting a blank row.  You have to open the insert tab and select ""insert new row."""

241460,-1.0,2018,"I just hate this product.  My company buys it for us to use but is it such a bad program.  It is basically a stripped down version of office. There is no excuse for selling this program.  If you need to do anything slightly advanced you will find that more often than not you will find the function has been removed even if that function was present in older Office versions from many years ago.  This is basically a demo or lite version of Office that you have to pay for every year, NOT the latest greatest and always the best available that you would think you are getting as a subscriber.  I will give you two examples of roadblocks I have run into trying to use this program.  First, when using the fill color function, there is no way to set the transparency of the color you are filling with, a function that has been around for at least a decade. Second, when using excel the option ""text to columns"" has been removed.  So if you are merging two databases and need to split first and last names you have to use this function to delimit by space and without this function, you can't do it.  Good luck if you want to anything more advanced than this."

The technician told me that he would analyze the problem which he did by taking remote control of the computer. He then informed me that the computer was infected by Trojan horse software and that for $200, he would remove all of the infection and restore the computer to working order, which he did. Afterward, I searched on line and found that some users think that they scam people by using free software (good for 30 days) and fix the issue in a few minutes but make it appear to take much longer. I am now concerned that they may have added other malware that my Avast security system can not detect.

I spoke with Microsoft customer service, and we were able to get it working again for about a week. Now it says it's unlicensed again. No idea, but not going to be going through Amazon for this stuff again..."
243792,-1.0,2018,I am very disappointed with Office 365.  I replaced my older computer and it came with Office 365.  After 1 year i still have problems.  It does not work- share data with my iphone.  Outlook is always having problems.  I find it poorly designed and difficult to use.  I set preferences and then they change back.  The search parameters are less helpful than in Office 2010.  I would like to get rid of Office 365 and go to regular -non subscription Office but i cannot figure out how.
243793,0.0,2018,"I had Office 2007, which I owned. I don't really see a lot of improvement or reason to upgrade to this now that I've done it. After my year is up, I'll probably uninstall and install 2007 once again. For the record, I'm an author. I use this software quite often. I'm not that impressed."

Then I reloaded 100 and the next morning I got up and found I had lost 60 pages. This is over 24 hours of work. Your system is not working. Getting in contact with Microsoft is almost impossible."
243798,1.0,2018,We use to buy a CD ROM for the same price and have it forever.  Now its a one year subscription. I think Microsoft office is going the way of cable in that its becoming more and more expensive and really its basically the same thing (sometimes no change is a good thing) .
243799,1.0,2018,It was easy to install. I don't like to have to buy a subscription every year. You used to be able to keep the current year until an upgrade was made in about 3 years.

I think its a reasonable monthly charge and you write it as an office expense."

243813,-1.0,2018,"BEWARE!  I purchased this product yesterday and spent several hours trying to get the Office 365 Personal activated. I kept getting a couldn't contact server error. I researched how to correct this, tried that but nothing worked. I then tried to activate it manually with the product key only to find out I had been given a invalid key code! Now I have piece of junk software that doesn't work. I can't use and they won't refund my money!"
243814,-1.0,2018,I purchased this product because my computer said I needed to reactivate my software.  I bought the download and downloaded per the instructions to my computer.

246071,1.0,2018,The word is Transparency: Malwarebytes is a great product and does everything it says it will do - But - how to load my License Key was not so great. I finally figured it out by trial and error. IPK
246072,1.0,2018,Everyone needs to have Malwarebytes in addition to their existing antivirus program. I have used it for a number of years now and it has caught a number of items that my AV program missed
246073,-1.0,2018,"Well what can I say? Malwarebytes and their customer service sucks. I purchased their lifetime license, 3 of them actually from Amazon Digital Services (directly from Amazon) back in 2014 or so. I was satisfied with the deal at that point but did not have a need for the Malware Byte until recently.. Well lo and behold I try to activate it and it does not let me, so I open up a support ticket with their support who tells me they can't honor the lifetime license because it was not valid and sold by a third party. As soon as I point out it was sold directly from Amazon their support team stops answering me. Malwarebytes = scam, malwarebytes customer service is quite possible the worst I have ever seen. Don't buy a malwarebytes premium license or any kind of license because they are a RIP OFF."
246074,-1.0,2018,"MALICIOUS software--occupied all of computer memory each time I booted, then crashed the system. Finally caught it doing this by watching the task master. Removed the program, and the problem disappeared. MAL-ware is absolutely correct; this is dangerous. Fortunately, no permanent damage."
246075,-1.0,2018,"I can't figure out  whether it works or not because,, after installing it and running one scan I clicked on it to see how often it was scanning and it said that I was running the FREE version not the one that I bought, which was PREMIUM.  I took the time to email Malwarebytes support and they informed me that there is no way that my computer will ever show a Premium Subscription because I did not purchase from Malwarebytes but through a 3rd party on Amazon.com, by the name of Techsales Deals.  Buyer Beware, this means that if you buy from Staples, will never show up as the proper subscription so you will have to re-activate every week or two!!!  I want a refund and as I explained to them, this is very poor business practice.  Even if there software is the best, we will never know if we cannot count on it to work as intended!  support.malwarebytes.com"
246076,-1.0,2018,"PAID to cover 3 premium (Lenovo, Dell) PCs (one XP SP3, two Win7 Pro) for 1 year each, ended up getting HALF-time coverage on each, because... this utility is EASILY BROKEN by Microsoft's normal updates!  And I don't even install MS updates the very day they come out (but first peruse tech blogs to see if any ""gotchas"" involved...).

So-called Tech Support consists of CANNED E-MAIL RESPONSES which... DON'T WORK to restore function, not even once.  Zero telephone contact.  Just had to wait for the next update of MalwareBytes... and hope no threats occurred during the ""vulnerability window"".  ""Hope"" is not a valid element of threat protection.  NO refunds--or even extension of the license--was given, despite polite requests for same."
246077,1.0,2018,Software appears to catch a lot of junk being sent to your computer from outside sources.
246078,1.0,2018,Its been almost a year and still no problems with my laptop.
246079,-1.0,2018,"This review is for an older version of the product I bought in 2015. The product was bought on amazon and had a lifetime access to the premium features. I had installed the product for about 6 months and it worked great till it hit some issues and I uninstalled it. Fast forward to 2018,  I decided to reinstall it from the Amazon software gallery and it installed correctly and accepted the license key and unlocked the premium features. On reboot, it prompted me to upgrade to latest version which I did. However, once on the latest version, I noticed it switched back to the free limited version. On typing in the key/license, it rejected the key. Now for 2 weeks I send multiple documents to Malwarebytes support for proof of purchase, screenshot of my amazon library showing the product with it's key and error message being thrown within the product. After 2 weeks of wasting my time, they asked me to ask Amazon for an alternate key (which does not make any sense). On contacting Amazon, they insist it is a publisher issue if the key/license doesn't work as intended.
Honestly, the purchase price is not worth the time I have spent on this. I would not recommend buying this product again just given the attitude of their customer support."

Opened it by pealing back the red seal (without damaging the envelope, first flag) Inside was the install disk and the serial number. Installed windows, and input the serial number. Second red flag was that the serial did not have the scratch away cover over the number, but I still tried. The serial number was not valid because it had already been used.

I purchased another copy elsewhere, had the proper anti-tamper measures and a valid license key."

247683,-1.0,2018,"While less of a dumpster fire than windows 8 (Which I refuse to touch) this is still complete trash. Microsoft hasn't produced a truly good operating system since XP. I did enjoy 7, I admit, it was a step in the right direction but it left too much stability behind. 10... is saying goodbye to your privacy. There were at least 30 settings I had to turn off on setup so the thing wouldn't spy on me, not to mention things you can't change like automated reboot times and the horrible update system that cannot be turned off. Seriously, I'm working on important things and you decide to reboot and install updates NOW? 0/10 would not recommend. Unless you have specialized programs like I do (If you do save REALLY OFTEN) then I recommend you go with Linux."

I checked the dvd sleeve as well and found no product key sticker attached to the Not the COA number. The disc was also pretty dirty, as if it came from a warehouse. I expected a good product with care, but in this case, I feel like I got scammed."
247688,1.0,2018,Did what it was supposed to do. I had originally installed windows 7 then upgraded to 8 then 10. When the system failed I could no recover from any of the recovery media I had so I had to format and start over. Has worked great since then.
247689,1.0,2018,"Worked perfectly. Must stress that it is an OEM version so should only be used on new PC builds. I built a new PC and then installed windows 10 with no problems. It isn't packaged as the picture as that looks like the retail version, but you receive a plain OEM package with the DVD and license number to stick on the back of the machine."
247690,0.0,2018,I don't like the idea of leasing Windows and allowing Microsoft the ability to update software without really telling me what is happening.

Product Dimensions: 7.5 x 5.5 x 0.1 inches

BUT

Product ships in a white envelope. Product Key is below scratch off Microsoft label.

What can I do front such panorame?"
247697,-1.0,2018,"I purchased Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 64 Bit OEM sold by Amazon (not a third party). What I received is a defective, illegitimate, and possibly fraudulent, copy of Windows 10.
All the seals were intact when I received it but:
Microsoft reports the key cannot be activated because it is invalid, rendering this product useless (no I wasn't mistyping and I did try to install with a different CD).
Though the packaging says the included CD is Version 1703 from 05/11/17 what installed was actually the unupdated, original Version 1500 from 2015.
It installed as English (United Kingdom) and it couldn't be changed to English (USA).

The last thing I was expecting was to purchase illegitimate software from Amazon. Thankfully I have gotten a refund.
I had no issues with Windows 10 Home 64 Bit OEM purchased from Amazon several months ago, but will be hesitant to trust purchasing software from Amazon again."

As already reported by others, while the product looks legitimate at first glance, there are ""problems"" that can be seen (it took me quite a bit of eyeballing to spot anything wrong).

247704,-1.0,2018,Would not activate.  Microsoft said that the product was either already used or counterfeit.  I purchased 3 of these.  This is the first one that I spent about 5 hours trying to figure out what was wrong with it.  I don't even want to bother with the other 2.
247705,0.0,2018,"Beware that when you install from scratch on a new formatted Hard Drive it will ask you to put in the license #, the problem is once it loads the operating system it will automatically activate your license, then when you download your drivers for your video card and install them it will correctly identify your video card but it will now think you have a new computer and it will say your license has already been used and will try to sell you a license from Microsoft for $200...  It's either that or Amazon is selling copies of windows 10 where the license has already been activated by someone else."

247709,-1.0,2018,This is bad! I bought this scratched off the code and put in the disk and the damn key doesn't work! When I called Microsoft they told me the code was already used and their was nothing they could do. My advice go buy in a real store this one will give you nothing but trouble.
247710,1.0,2018,"Well I had to update from Vista64 because some of the software and drivers are not longer supported.  So I bit the bullet and ordered a new hard drive, a hard drive switch box, and Windows 10.  The install went so smoothly that I decided to do my wife's computer also in the same way.  So now we both have dual boot systems with a push of a button.  Windows 10 is awesome."
247711,1.0,2018,I am a Microsoft fanboy
247712,1.0,2018,Perfect product at a great price.  Thanks.
247713,1.0,2018,I don't know about the actual windows 10. Over the years I have loaded many products you had to have a key for. I had to order windows 10 again  because it is a scratch off to see the key. One half wouldn't scratch off finally it did taking part of the key making it uses less with out a key. Hopefully the replacement key won't  hold up a new build that only needs windows to be up and running.
247714,0.0,2018,I'm only giving this three start because I couldn't load this on to my computer so am not sure the code is good or bad. I had a copy of windows 7 and had a Microsoft account. Microsoft went a head and loaded the original software and did the upgrade to pro when I went to download this from their website so I'm not sure the reason it rejected the code was because the computer was already licensed with a copy of windows 10 pro so I'll give this a medium review but may deserve a 5 star review. I'm sure I'll find out down the road.
247716,-1.0,2018,Disk was corrupted and took hours to get this installed.  I would recommend just downloading the windows 10 USB installer (which I ended up having to do) and then buying a key from g2a or another key reseller site or Microsoft directly.
247717,1.0,2018,Worked perfectly several times. No complaints. Great product and fast delivery. No license or key issues. Excellent buy.
247718,-1.0,2018,I never thought I would regret buying a Microsoft operating system until I bought Windows 10. I have bought many operating systems from Microsoft in the past for the computers that I have built. But never have I had too many issues with them (even with Windows ME) like the ones I have had with this trash system. Computer sellers may recommend it because of wanting to sell their products but I as a consumer would stick with Windows 7 or 8 until Microsoft comes out with a new system. Then again the consumer has the last word in making a decision of upgrading to this program or waiting for what lies in the future.
247720,-1.0,2018,Can't activate Windows key.
247721,-1.0,2018,Product said it had already been activated when I tried to use it. Also barcode stickers were covered up with other blank stickers. Something's not right about this copy.

247723,-1.0,2018,The product received had an already used activation key.
247724,-1.0,2018,"I had a client order this along with an Intel NUC. The DVD would only install as UK English. There were no other options. I used a generic ISO from Microsoft and applied the key, which worked, but it is totally unacceptable that Amazon is selling this garbage. I have to worry about this client's computer going dead a year from now because Microsoft decides the key is invalid. It is also unacceptable that Microsoft isn't policing the sale of its products. This is sold by Amazon, not some vendor in a basement store in Brooklyn that buys their disks from China.. I feel like I need to wash my hands. Amazon, you have lost my confidence as a supplier of tech hardware and software. .

Edit: Just received another one that a client purchased and it wouldn't activate at all. It was odd from the beginning by not having the scratch off foil. The key was fully visible and printed on multiple lines on the tag. Does someone have Microsoft's piracy reporting telephone number.

Edit on 4/13/18  Yesterday installed yet another copy of this for a client that was received some time the week prior. All good on this one. Foil over a key that worked. Maybe Amazon has flushed out the garbage."

Also, the recognition, no matter how much training, sucks. Don't bother purchasing this. You won't use it over the long term. It's useless."

I have been very pleased with voice recognition though it does have some glitches. My computer for voice recognition recently failed, the old versions I had available would not load on Windows 10. After much angst, I ordered Dragon NaturallySpeaking premium 13. I downloaded it in under 30 minutes on my new Windows 10 computer and was dictating with minimal errors and no training within 30 minutes. the only errors that occurred were with scientific jargon and after adding these to the vocabulary, I had no further glitches.

Saying ""Choose 2"" or other numbers in a ""Spell that"" list instead writes ""20"" instead of the spoken option. Dragon practically never gets ""too"" correctly vs ""to"". Since Dragon screws up the above and other things often, it requires manual correction, but then for some reason tries to correct your corrections - such as adding periods, spaces, and capitalization for no reason at all, and Dragon occasionally does this when speaking too."

Some of your recent digital software and video game purchases are still being processed. Visit Your Orders page for details.""

I have no way of contacting anybody to get the key or get help.  I bought this product through download as I have a new PC,  I want to start using it right away - but can't install without a key and the Amazon installer also barfs because of no keys!
Biggest gripe is there is NOTHING to direct me as to what to do when the process doesn't work.  You have my money - how do I get the entire product????????"
252966,-1.0,2018,"To be clear, I am giving this a 1-Star based upon the advertised ability of the product to transcribe audio recordings.  The product does fairly well with text-to speech, but honestly no better at all than Google Docs will do for free. I am a student doing a qualitative research paper where I have to transcribe dozens of interviews.  I figured this would be a cheap way to upload and transcribe the recordings rather than pay what would potentially be hundreds of dollars for a transcriber to perform the transcription. If you are thinking of purchasing this product for the same purpose - know the following:

- The latest versions of Windows Voice Recorder, iPhones, and Galaxy record files in a m4a format, which Dragon cannot recognize. You will have to convert every file from m4a to mp3, which can take a minute depending on the amount of files.  Also, really the only trusted software to do that with is iTunes, but if you are an Android or Samsung user, it will take a while to set up the account and transfer the files.
- The recording transcription places the text in one large block, and does not separate or create space between speakers - so right off the bat, you will have to go in and edit the transcription to be in a readable format.
- Dragon seriously struggles to accurately transcribe any non-native, English speakers on recordings.  The software is set to recognize the voice of the User Profile.  If the other voices are native, English speakers, it can transcribe them, but will still not differentiate between changing of speakers. However, non-native speaker transcriptions result in incoherent sentences.
- The transcription takes a really long time. It took the about 40 minutes to transcribe a 23 minute interview.
- Dragon generally does a poor job of transcribing audio, especially for advertising the audio transcription process as such a key feature. At the end of the day, even of all of these aforementioned issues are not a problem for you, I was still left with such a poor transcription of the audio, the data was not usable to run through a qualitative, coding, analytic software.

Additionally, for what this software is, and loading it onto a computer, Dragon takes a solid hour to upload and setup.

Do not buy this for transcribing recordings.  I am not espousing the benefits of other websites, but in examining other options before paying $1 a minute for transcription by a human, I did check out a free transcription from one Web-site called Tempi - and it at least denoted differences between who was speaking, and included time signatures of when the breaks took place, and this was for only about $.10 cents a minute.  Not ideal, but I am on a time crunch at this point.

Thankfully, Amazon is allowing me to return the product."
252977,-1.0,2018,"I wish it were possible to give  this product a negative star review. Trying to download the Dragon Premium 13.0 software took almost  four hours and multiple phone calls with the Amazon help desk. Ultimately, I gave up in total frustration.  I won't get into too many details because that would further waste my time. One time, the Nuance download site tried to get me to download the Windows XP version of the product, when I clearly was attempting to purchase the Windows 10 version. I tried around three more  times to download the Windows 10 version. Each time I failed because the Nuance download portal was unable to provide the product key.  I repeatedly encountered Gateway error 817 which told me to to get a key, but that was something that was impossible to do. At one time I was ""attempting"" to purchase two concurrent downloads of the software.

  The Amazon Help Desk personnel were fantastic. One reported that she had encountered another customer the evening before who had the identical problem. She flagged the Dragon software download as being problematic. From my perspective as an unhappy customer, it seems that Nuance  has made a business decision to cease supporting the  Dragon product. There is no other obvious explanation. I have been purchasing software from Amazon for many years with problem or incident. This was the first time that I have ever called the Amazon Help desk for any problem. In this case I called three times. On two of those calls, I was escalated from the primary help desk to the games and software group.  During one of those calls, I was on hold for 15-20 minutes while the technician tried - unsuccessfully - to determine the cause of the problem. There appears to be no other solution or explanation.

  I have no opinion about the Dragon software because I have been unable to use it."

INSTALL - the Amazon digital download service work is expected no issues here. The one good thing about this is your product key and software is available for future reference through Amazon and you don't have to worry about keeping up with email, a CD or things like that.

SET up and configuration - this is where the rope comes in. to keep things simple I am using Microsoft window 10 professional.
My preferred browser is Firefox, I use Skype for interacting with my peers for work and they use a virtual desktop application required for my job.
I use office 365 and I access it through Firefox. I use many more applications but these are the three core must have working as expected tools for work.

+++++++++++++
PRODUCT USE

I recommend for anybody that is new to this product, after you install it and open the application go to the help and click on learning center. keep this in mind however; while dictating there are commands that allow you to do work formats. One in the learning center tells you that if you want a single word to be all capital, then use this command; cap <word> . I now am going to do that in this review, cap This word. as you can see it did not capitalize the entire word. I slightly modified the command on my own, all caps <word> and this is what it looks like - HELLO. As you can see the capitalized hello as expected now.

As with anything there is a huge learning curve. One thing that I learned early on that this product is to speak very slowly and methodically until you get the hang of the commands and dictating. Imagine being a secretary and being asked by your boss to write down what your boss is going to dictate. If you don't know shorthand you'd wish your boss would speak slowly in order for you to hear and then write everything that is being said. That is what's going on with the software it is your virtual secretary and you are dictating to it.

When you first try to use Dragon within my Firefox application it asks you to ""Install Dragon web extension for Firefox"". when you try to do that and following the on-screen instructions that fails to install. see my screenshot I'm attaching.

when I try to use Dragon within Skype, I quicken my message and begin to dictate. Dragon open a dictation box pop-up and you see the text to what you dictated. It also presents an option to transfer, The transfer button nothing seems to happen. I then tried clicking the ctrl+V key stroke and the dictated text appeared in Skype. This may not seem so bad but the whole idea is to talk and have your words dictated out and into an application. In past versions that's how it worked, but now not so much.

NUANCE SUPPORT - save this its not easy to find (770) 702-6014it  opens at 9 AM Eastern standard Time. the following are the responses to my issues experienced when I called them. HINT - before you call them activate and register your product otherwise they will not provide you support even if you provide them a valid key that Amazon notes in your digital software library.

1. Firefox - not fully supported download and use chrome
2. Skype - third-party product not fully supported
3. MS Outlook - third-party product not fully supported

SELF RELIANCE
 Nuance is the third-party application here. They are the ones promoting dictation to improve your experience with your PC or Mac. Their software is not cheap and their support did not WOW me. this all became very frustrating to me.

I immediately went after the option under the miscellaneous tab; ""Use the dictation box for unsupported applications""  and unchecked it. once I did this I was no longer presented with the dictation box and my dictation text began appearing as I dictated and within Skype and other applications.

now that I'm able to dictate is just a matter of training the new install with my speech pattern. I hope this review helps those contemplating this product or who have experience the same and how to fix it to make it at least a little functional."
252986,-1.0,2018,Download will not work.  Cannot get any mic to work with this program.  Instructions are vague and multi-step downloads of unrelated programs and most instructions refer to mobile operating systems iOS or Android but download was for the Windows version.  Total waste of $100.
252997,1.0,2018,I'm loving this software! I have bad arthritis in my hands that make working at my computer difficult.

252998,1.0,2018,"I would not have been able to install and use this software without Scott Baker's independently published guide to ""Training your Dragon"" but now that I have it up and running I am satisfied. I find it very, very hard to ""train"" the software and find it faster to fix mistakes manually rather than attempting to train the voice recognition software. But all in all, it does help. I have dictated significant parts of my last 4 novels using this software. It does not help me write more per day. Dictating is faster but all the manual corrections make my total time as long as it would be if I had just typed the while time. However, I am able to spend part of that time walking outside while dictating instead of sitting, and overall, I end up hitting the keyboard less which helps allieviate the wrist problems I get. I highly recommend buying Scott Baker's guide to be able to buy the right version and get it to work."

Then I gave up when I could not get past the next screen when the program did not respond to a ""continue"" button.  If installation does not work, what is the rest of the program like? I do not need more frustrating software in my life."

253005,-1.0,2018,Bought DNS v13 in 2015. I use it on a PC running Windows 10 (Home). Every time Windows updates its software the DNS starts acting up. the latest software update by Windows has resulted in DNS running slow and at the end of every sentence it causes Windows Word to go to a blank white screen. So every sentence i dictate takes about 1 minute to complete. I called tech support twice and each time the changes they recommended resulted in minimal improvement. Very frustrating. DNS/Nuance is aware of the incompatibility issue and refuses to provide a work around or patch to correct it. I am looking to get rid of DNS. I am an attorney that has a solo law office and a student that transcribes college lectures. I have a PC running Windows 10 Home version. Does anyone have a recommendation for a dictation recorder?

Beware of buying this product, unless you like putting $110 down the rathole. I have had lots of problems with DNS since I started with it in the very earliest editions many years ago, but this takes the cake! They protect their cash flow by not funding returns on a nonfunctional product. Very creative, but it has me looking for an alternative product backed by a company with integrity."

Unlike others, I have been able to get my software to run but occasionally, it will lose and exe file or just otherwise go on the blink.  I have both Dragon and the Pdf Converter programs.  The programs seem to be fine when they work.  It feels as though they have a planned obsolescence involved somehow so that you have to keep upgrading or repurchasing the software to get any kind of support.  The live support lasts about as long as it takes them to charge your credit card.  The real shame here is that their CEO is among the highest paid in the nation and they are probably the main producer of voice to dictate and pdf manipulation software producers in the country.  My guess is that they probably have enough money to sue all of their competitors and chase them off then they get to gouge you again and again making you continue to purchase new iterations of their product.  I cannot tell you not to purchase the software because there are really no other viable alternatives.  If we had a decent Justice Department they would sue the pants off these clowns until they start producing for the general public.  A 25% disapproval rate cannot be good."
253021,-1.0,2018,Even though it says it will run on Windows 10 one of their sales reps clearly told me that no it won't.

A person needs to remember that you must constantly correct the program and as you do this the program attains a level of perfection that is truly wonderful.  I have read that there are some people who, because of their bizarre accents, have problems with this software.  This is their problem, it is not my problem.  This product is wonderful.  It does need to be installed on a good computer, adequate memory, good sound card or audio chips on motherboard, multicored CPU."

I am running Windows 10 and use Word 2016 and although Nuance says this version of Word is not compatible with DP 13, it seems to be compatible enough to do what I want it to do.  I don't do extensive commands on word but do oral corrections and punctuation and these are perfect.  The learning curve is pretty short for the user as well as the program and I am impressed with how much the program recognizes with very minimal training.  Registration was simple and easy. I do wish that Nuance would update their equipment compatibility list but if you use one of their 6 star recommendations, it works well.  I'm using a Blue Yeti microphone and find that it decreased recognition errors dramatically.  I have also tried using an Olympus DM-720 handheld recorder and find the recognition to be excellant with this as well.  Don't upgrade to vers. 15 or you will lose the ability to have the program transcribe from a handheld.  They will force you to use the app which costs $15.00 a month.

DO NOT DIGTIALLY DOWNLOAD hence the bulk of the bad reviews come from this problem. Don't let the low rating's prevent you from getting this software..... Most negative comments are the non tech savy people complaing about why there computer is obsolete to this program or simpily cannot install because they have never installed anything in there computer's before..... Again some people were saying ""It's too complicated to install"" My take on it is, it's not difficult at all..... and I'm not a computer programmer or I don't really consider myself extradionary tech savy either....."

After two phone calls to clueless support personnel at Nuance (Dragon), I learn that the version Amazon says is compatible with Windows 10 (Dragon NaturallySpeaking Premium 13) was compatible with the original version of Windows 10, but it is NOT compatible with subsequent versions of Windows 10. And Nuance does not want to upgrade the program because then their Professional version would not be worth anything. My choices: return this and buy the Professional version, or buy an upgrade patch for $100.
I've never encountered such an approach, with any other software.
But why does Amazon advertise that it is compatible with Windows 10? That is simply false, if you have maintained your software in a responsible way."

I managed to get it working for about five minutes while dictating a Word document before it unexplainably reverted back to the install stage and I had to start all over again. Now I can't dictate anything. I've spent hours trying to figure this thing out and it's ridiculously complicated.

253851,1.0,2018,"I have used Dragon since version 8. It had been pretty hit and miss back in those days.

Version 13 is pretty tight. I very rarely swear at it like I did in the old days. : )

I am a writer and it makes it a breeze to do the rough draft of stories. Intricate editing not so much. But for me that is a huge time saver.

One big improvement is getting a new headset. WARNING. Just because you think a headset is good doesn't mean that it is good for Dragon. There is a great company to help with finding it because Nuance is no help here. I have had great experiences with KnowBrainer.com. They help handicapped people use Dragon to enhance their lives. KnowBrainer has a list of headset microphones that work the best with Dragon.

For example I bought a set of Sennheiser headsets which are normally a great brand. Well they weren't very good for Dragon.

One down side is Nuance is not the best with support. Dragon software has been sold a few times. And sadly support has not improved with the new companies.

I will say that it has been rare that I have needed support."

253853,-1.0,2018,"For so long I have yearned for speech to text translation.  Back when the IBM PC first came out, there was hardware you could buy that promised little, but delivered far less.  My wife and I still laugh at ""CANCEL! CANCEL!  CANCEL!"" -- my screams at this idiotic stuff, getting everything wrong including what to do in response to ""CANCEL!""

Today, we have Dragon NaturallySpeaking, which promises much more, but still delivers less than anyone might want.

The product install fails, and you'll need to locate msxml.msi on your own, run it after your install fails, and before you will get this thing to work.  Once installed, be prepared to speak very clearly, at just the pace Dragon wants. In Dictate mode, Dragon dictates how to speak, and how fast.  And be prepared to grab your mouse and keyboard and manually repair what it thinks you've said.  You'll have to be very good to be able to dictate faster than you can type, I think.

This is software, and Amazon wisely won't take it back.  I can't blame them.  So all I can say is don't get it in the first place."

253873,1.0,2018,"I've used three previous versions of Dragon (8,10 and 12), and was pretty lukewarm about those.  But with 13 Home (and maybe with 12.5), there's some kind of corner that the recognition ""engine"" has made, and now it's much more accurate, with relatively little training.  I've tried it on both my Windows 7 laptop and Windows 10 desktop with amazing results, where free flowing text is 90+ percent accurate, and often whole paragraphs are mistake-free.

I did purchase a higher quality USB microphone, but even the unit that came with the CD was pretty accurate.

However, my focus is on first drafts of longer emails, notes, and transcribing hand-written fiction into a computer document.  I can easily churn out 1000 words in 10 minutes, spend one or two minutes manually correcting things, and it's done.  A great time saver.  If expanding the use of the product to perform more detailed tasks or control your computer, then the expectations need to be adjusted.  It's going to take more time to ""train"" it, and learn the limitations, with much more time necessary for the proper learning curve.  I have not yet tried anything to complicated, but at least this version is going to allow me that option.  Previous versions I just got frustrated with simple drafts."

To get it reactivated we must spend hours with the customer service staff, some of whom seem to know very little about computers or voice recognition systems.

All in all, horrible experience!"

253890,1.0,2018,"I purchased version 13 for home usage. its accuracy is amazingly superior to versions 10 and 12, both of which I have had. However, at times my computer appears to have too many resources running, resulting is painfully long response times. Even a single word can take minutes to display. One time when it happened, I shut down Google and almost immediately got a better response time. Be prepared to do the same. But if you hate to type or make many typing errors, Dragon Naturally Speaking is your remedy. My only warning is that you discipline yourself to learn the commands that make corrections an easy task. Dragon Bar occasionally misunderstands a word and displays wording that must be changed. Some other words it seems to know from context and can, therefore, distinguish among homonyms like to, too or two, or for, fore and four. I can't say enough good about this product except for the times the computer over-load simply won't let it function."

253892,-1.0,2018,"8 years ago the version of this product worked reasonably well with Windows XP. The error rate was a little high, but manageable.  Using this version (13) on Windows 10 is completely unusable.  99% accuracy?  Try 10% at best.  It is truly horrendous.  It may not be entirely the fault of Nuance, but of Microsoft.  Windows 10 apparently has quite a problem with microphones.  I tried a notebook computer built in mic, a couple of usb mics, and an audio jack mic.  It just did not matter.  The sound was very low and if adjusted, tended to distort.  You could say that there are a few things that are unusable and horrific about Windows 10.  Microsoft doesn't seem to be concerned about fixing the issue since it has been broken for some time.  Nuance hasn't seen fit to provide any fix either. The Mac version may work.  A Linux version might work (if there was one.)  Don't waste your time or money on this if you are using Windows 10."

I'm having to do some dictation with medical terminology and it works great I love it. I wish I would've considered purchasing this unit months ago as I believe I would have been able to accomplish a lot more work with my note taking. It's amazing it works so well. It's easy to use. I recommend this definitely
253909,1.0,2018,"First one I ordered didn't work, refused to download from the disc.  Returned it to Amazon and requested a new package.  Was skeptical if it would work after reading all of the negative reviews of this product.  Once the new disc arrived, it took awhile to load it onto my computer but once it was installed I have been pleasantly surprised and actually quite thrilled with how it works.  Now this isn't a product that you just quickly install and use if you want to use all of it's features and I am still learning about it, but I do a lot of reports for attorney's and I am very pleased with the product.  It's accuracy so far is adequate for my needs although I still do some typing corrections, but like I said I'm still learning the program and it will take awhile for me to learn the program and for the program to learn the vocabulary that I use and the report format that the attorneys require of me, but I am pleasantly surprised.

I would only purchase it from Amazon due to the return policy that Amazon has.  First one didn't work, second one works fine, doesn't lock my computer, doesn't affect any other programs.  Only drawback I see right now is that the microphone picks up background music so when you're pausing to gather your thoughts and your playing music (I'm old, so I like oldies music) I get Neil Diamond or the Beatles lyrics being typed so that's a bit of a bummer but otherwise very pleased with this product."
253910,1.0,2018,"Okay, why are people giving this program any hate???? This software is FANTASTIC! Ignore the bad reviews, honestly. Please read this one for an honest rundown...

Here's my situation: I'm a longtime writer (~5000 words a day, a lot!) that developed carpel tunnel at the age of 24. Naturally, I was freaking out...so I looked into alternatives to writing. I stumbled upon speaking software: cue Dragon NaturallySpeaking Home 13.0! Let me break this down:

Pros
1) VERY accurate. I don't know why people are saying it isn't. This software lets you TRAIN it in certain words. For example, I'm British with a 'posh-ish' accent, so there are a few words that a say that sound pretty stupid if I'm being honest. If the software doesn't pick up the word right away, I go into the vocabulary interface, type in the word, and click train. It brings up the word, I press 'go,' and then I say the word. Then when I say it in document or in email, it picks it up correctly every time. Works like a charm!
2) You can ADD WORDS to the vocabulary list. I write fantasy, so this was a HUGE advantage...no, I mean HUGE. New names, places, things, you name it! I could add it all to the vocabulary list and it picks up on it as if it were in the English language all along. Even cooler...and this one really gets me going...I created a language, and this software now understands every word I say in it! How cool is that!?
3) It's quick in the typing. Perhaps people that found it 'slow' need to update their computer's drivers, but for me this program worked very quickly. I could orate an entire paragraph (200 words or so), and it would pick it up correctly. Now, it doesn't write each word as you say it in real time, and here's why: it's using context clues to ensure it puts the right word in. For example, I say: 'which way do we go?' Now, if the software wrote word for word, it would have no idea which 'which' to use, right? It might come out as: 'witch way...' That's why it shouldn't write word for word, because that's not how we speak in real life anyway! We have to listen to the full line when someone is speaking to place the right word in there ;) and that's exactly what this software is doing!
4) Installation was super easy for me. I used the download, which took in total about 20 minutes. Worked like a charm for me :) don't know why any others had any difficulties.
5) Okay...you can literally use a previous document and have this software read it to gain insight into your writing style and any new vocabulary words! That's also what I did for my first two novels, so I didn't have to manually put in any place, character, or 'thing' names at all! Once it picked out all the new vocabulary words (which also works as a great 'editor' too for quick spelling mistakes...fun fact ;) ), I could train the software with the pronunciation in each. Perfect! Saved me a lot of time and even made sure I used consistent spelling for new words.

Cons
Occasionally misses a word...but why wouldn't you apply the same filter to this software as your own typing? Are you 100 % accurate (even in speaking to be honest!)? Do you always use the right word? How about the correct punctuation? I certainly don't... Look, this software isn't infallible, obviously, but let's not apply unrealistic expectations. For example, if I say 'then' versus 'than,' it might mix it up once or twice, especially if I pause just a few moments too long. It takes two seconds to fix: say 'undo' and then the correct version, emphasizing the 'an' or 'en' at the end, and it's as good as new.
Can't have other people talking around you, but that's hardly a 'con,' right? More of a duh ;)

At the end of the day, this software has enabled me to keep writing my novels. I now have decades of writing ahead of me, and this software made that possible (not being melodramatic, just honest :) ). In fact, and I was pretty surprised by this, but I can now write stories even faster than I did before! :0 For giving me back my 'writing' hand back, I'd give this product more than 5 stars if I could. I absolutely love it and would recommend it to EVERYONE that needs a great voice recognition software!

All the best,
Fellow Amazon Customer"

Once I said ""Rebooted the PC"" and DNS almost rebooted my PC. I've tried turning off the Commands portion, but that does restrict the functionality of the PC.

BTW, it does not type curse words. You still have to delete the gibberish, but at least it is not profane. :)"

253936,-1.0,2018,CORRUPTED FILES  DOWNLOAD NONFUNCTIONAL
253937,-1.0,2018,"Final update: I gave this piece of junk the old college try, and it utterly flopped. Tonight, after losing 5 full pages, perhaps 7,500 words, and not being able to retrieve them, I uninstalled the program, and chalked it up to a $100 mistake. I'll never deal with Nuance again.

Again, total junk, and no customer service available unless you're willing to pay. Keep this in mind: Google's speech-to-text is free, and it has an error rate that's better than the $100 Dragon fiasco. Don't be foolish, save your money!!!

Update: I decided to bump this up to two stars. After using it for about a month, I found it's pretty good at taking dictation correctly, though it needs to be carefully proofread. But that's all it does. No matter what the manufacturer claims, it will not perform formatting functions. All it does is take dictation. It will do very simple commands, such as paragraph breaks, and it's about it. This, I believe, is done on purpose. It's a form of bait-and-switch, and if I were a younger man I would pursue the issue and file a complaint with our Atty. Gen. You buy the home version for a reasonable price having certain expectations, customer service suggests you by the professional version but $300. If they think I'm going to trust them now with $300, then they're crazier than I am.

Look. Don't buy this software. It's all there is out there, and the sorry state of this product indicates voice to text as a practical thing is a very long way off, and Nuance is only interested in emptying your wallet. If all you want is dictation software, Google's free version is more than adequate. It works about as well as Dragon, and it's learning capability is limited. But it's free. Dragon cost nearly hundred dollars, and it's not going to work any better. If you want more than dictation software go ahead and throw your money at the more expensive versions of NaturallySpeaking. Maybe they work better, and you're welcome to waste your money to giving them a try, but for me? Once bitten twice shy.

After trying this program for a week, including buying a Kindle book which is supposed to master using this program right out of the box, I decided and that the whole thing is a big bait-and-switch fraud. It is fundamentally unable to differentiate between whether a word that serves as a command, such as the word. As you can see it interpreted the word ""period"" (manually typed in) as the punctuation mark. But what about if I want to write about the . in time? Or this particular bit of madness: when writing about diabetes there is a[type] 1 and a [Type] 2, but saying Type 1 and getting only the numeral 1 is problematic.

I suspect most people who have no trouble with Dragon are those who have purchased the Premium or Professional versions. The $75 ""basic"", which claimed to be perfect for my needs, is utterly useless. It's worsened by the need to enunciate each word individually and carefully, which defeats the purpose of dictating in the first place. Having to watch the screen as you go, or spend at least as much time manually editing dragons [Dragon's] mistakes as you do dictating, then we have a problem.

I've done my due diligence when it comes to giving this program every chance to see [succeed]. It's fundamental inability to learn my speech patterns, and differentiate between what should be carried out as a command or spelled out as dictated text, make this a useless program for the basic user. Even though it has as many problems and idiosyncrasies as Dragon version 13, it has the virtue of being free. So let's see, spend $75 on something that is marginally functional, or get that same marginal functionality for free. Seems like a no-brainer in hindsight.

Now time for me to go fight customer service to get my money back. Good luck to all who decide to go with this program. May you have better luck than I have."
253938,-1.0,2018,"I'm sure the product could be great, unfortunately purchasing it at this time is essentially asking to spend time on the phone, 15-20 minutes, trying to get a refund from amazon. If you're successful, yay! I'm still on the phone.

Either way, poor show Nuance, Poor show."
253939,0.0,2018,"I don't really hate the product yet, but the download edition has problems.  A 500 MB installer downloads and runs with an error report of a corrupted file with suggestion to retry.  After multiple retries, I gave up.  The file on the server must be corrupted.  Please fix the file on the server!  Thank you.

Note that I have tried to report the problem through other means, but I have not found a clear reporting mechanism.  All available help assumes the problem is on the consumer's end or that the consumer needs help with computer basics.  This is not the case for me.

I will update or remove this review after I get help from Amazon.  Nuance (the company) cannot help with an Amazon issue.

update Feb. 24, 2018 - Buyer continue to beware!  A call to customer service at Amazon has resolved my issue, but the file on the server is still corrupted as far as I know.  Amazon allowed a 1-time exception to the no refunds policy.  I have placed an order for the CD version of the software to ensure I have it as quickly as possible.  Nuance could not be reached by the customer service rep while I was on the phone."

Review
I bought this one because it was the cheapest, but didn't consider the add-ons
1. Headphones ( the ones with two prongs and mic)
2. special connection jack
3. second special connection jack since the first one didn't fit my computer.

It takes an hour to upload. I also had to watch Youtube videos to install the voice recognition mike and software, which I did. Ran through the tutorial, which shows you many things you can do--only to find out my version didn't do it.

I went to the Chrome store and added a dictation box, since the software is made to work with Internet Explorer.

On the introduction, I could choose from Southern American, Spanish Accented English, British English, and Standard. I chose standard, but soon found out certain words with U, OUR, or OU the the software had no clue what I was saying. I did talk slowly, ennunciate, and in full sentences.

It also has an issue with homonyms. It spelled dawn as Dawn and Don. I could not use quote marks because my version didn't support it.

I have read online that I can go into Microsoft office and tweak a few things, so I might try that.

The home version is good for writing emails and searching the web. These were never things I had issues with. In the end, it made more work for me."

NOT USER FRIENDLY as far as the set up.  He has had to have some come over several times to try to get it installed and is very frustrated.  I will not be replacing this again for him I will be looking into a different product and make sure its easily installed

I'm hoping to find a use for this, but it doesn't help with the project I'm working on."
253947,1.0,2018,I was very limited on the amount of typing that I could do because of physical problems. The program has given me a new leash on life and I am able to continue to work. Thank you for the great product.

253949,-1.0,2018,SCAM ALERT!!! THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT DOWNLOAD- I purchased this software after breaking my right arm. I needed this to allow me to continue remote work as Director of HR for a nationwide company. My corporate IT team attempted to load the product and said the entire product is not really there. The digital packaging does not give you the actual product and it cannot be loaded at all. I called Customer Service and the agent could speak little to no English. They told me there was nothing they could do. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED THAT AMAZON WOULD PERMIT A FRAUDULENT VENDOR SUCH AS THIS ONE. I am completing a report with the Better Business Bureau today.

253955,-1.0,2018,"I downloaded the software after paying my $59 + tax.  Being 3.5 GB, it took nearly a day to download. Regardless, I installed it without any trouble.  I then tried to run it - no luck.  All I got was an hour-glass on the screen for about 5 seconds and then nothing. No error messages, no flash screen(?), no nothing. I looked on the Internet and saw that many had this type of problem.  I tried various solutions to no avail. Tech Support tried to help, but ultimately said that I should check forums and such to find a solution.  WOW, what help!

Since I downloaded the software, I can not get a refund from Amazon.  I understand their viewpoint on downloaded software, but it still hurts to not be able to get a refund.  This review is my only way to stop others from making the same mistake.  Someone suggested Google Docs Voice Recognition; I may try that next."

253962,1.0,2018,"I have been experimenting with this program for a few months now. It does take some time, and user adaptation to this format of dictating things.

While I find it is working out great, I have made some concessions. For instance, as I dictate these words, I am intentionally spacing them out a little like a robot. It gives me a massive boost in accuracy to do so. Of course, the downside is that if anyone heard me they might have a laugh. Who is listening to you dictate text though? So, I'm not really bothered by it now, and I do like using my voice instead of the thin, unsatisfying keys on my laptop.

I would also add that I appreciate that I continue to discover new features. There have been many times when I just thought of a way to describe something I want the program to do, and it understands. For instance today I wanted roman numerals so I just said that before the number and it did it appropriately. As you pick up on the little things like that, it can be enjoyable to work with the program. At first, you might be put off getting use to speak your dictation at a pace that doesn't overwhelm the software, but now I find that I am fairly satisfied with it.

I do wish that updating the words you are speaking on screen, and updating the program's status after training it was faster. However, once you have it transcribing reliably you can overlook these things."

I feel like such an idiot for paying for this software three different times over the years.

Nuance is not very forthcoming about that information till after you purchase it and call their support line.
If your intentions are to use this with anything other than Microsoft Office 2016 you should be aware of that fact.
You will be forced to using the dictation pad and copying and pasting. Enabling the Microsoft added will cause your PC to crash."

Granted, there are some issues with the way it understands me (even after I've trained the program, twice). However, as far as speech to text goes, this program is the best! I also think that the fact that I'm using a web cam microphone might be why I'm having some of the issues that I have. The software does come with its own microphone headset, I just don't use it because it keeps me tethered to the computer. If anybody can recommend a good wireless microphone headset (or microphone) that I can wear with my bowler hat, I'd be appreciative!"

253987,1.0,2018,"Since purchasing Dragon Naturally-speaking Home back in 2016, I have since used the product for a number of duties. Mostly I use Dragon to write up ideas and rough drafts for comics, but there are several times in which I have completed full articles with Dragon. Blog Posts are a breeze, and just about anything else you need the use of speech to text for.

Plug in your mic...load the software...say what you want to say...watch it become text....Simple and plain! You do have to say what punctuation you want to place in the text, but the flow is still smooth and easy going once you get the hang of it.

You do!...need to speak clear and make sure to have a decent microphone. Background noise should be kept to a minimum as well, as I have experienced interference if I had ""too much going on in the background"".

If you are looking to rest your hands and allow yourself the freedom to sit back, relax, and ""let it flow"", then this would be a good purchase for you.

The Home version has all the tools needed to get the job done without updating and spending any more cash.

There are random update notifications you will get from time to time in the task bar. If it is a software update then that is ok, but if it recommends that you upgrade to make your experience better...as long as everything is working as needed, keep rolling with what you got. Advertising is always going to try and make you spend more money...I understand that and honestly, if you require more power from the program...then check out the upgrade possibilities. Depending on your needs there may be more available for your situation than the Home Version provides, for for the ""average user"" this version has proven to be very helpful indeed!

If you really want to make the experience wonderful...

Invest in a uni-directional microphone. They are good at picking up sound from a single source, as well as blocking out background noise.

That does it for my review of the software. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do to this day."

274484,1.0,2018,"I reconfigured a Lenovo computer from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.  I opted for complete replacement, keeping no legacy drivers or programs from Windows 8.1.  It was the best decision I made in this regard as the computer regained its super speed and response.  This program was extremely helpful in the configuration of the drivers for the equipment internal to the laptop, and as a bonus, helped me to 'plug 'n play' my peripherals as well.  Highly recommended"
274485,-1.0,2018,i got the item and put it in computer and nothing happened for me. it was suppose to update my outdated drivers but didn't
274486,-1.0,2018,Could not upload. I return it.

274490,1.0,2018,"The disk arrived quickly and is completely compatible with the Windows 7 operating system that I had just installed on an HP computer.  Without the disk, I had no way to download any drivers to the computer and the Windows 7 DVD didn't have drivers for this particular computer.  After installing the drivers from the disk, I was able to go on line and update all the drivers and install new drivers that were needed."
274491,0.0,2018,All it did was to tell me my drivers were up to date.
274492,-1.0,2018,Woefully fell below expectation.
274493,-1.0,2018,"I am running Vista with home premium package, the system has never been on the internet. After installing the recommended drivers my system froze. My only solution was to do a partition recovery. I flipped my 2018 drivers CD in the trash!"

274501,-1.0,2018,did not have all the drivers as advertised and would not download from internet search to solve driver problem.  Did not solve basic USB serial bus driver problem.
274502,-1.0,2018,Not an authentic replacement for OFFICE . I was not able to open many previously saved files written on Microsoft Office.
274503,-1.0,2018,it did not work.
274504,-1.0,2018,I decided to try this rather than the pricey office.. waste of money.. disc arrived . .and it won't even load to install.  its already on the way back to amazon.. You get what you pay for!

274514,1.0,2018,"I have been trying for some time to bring my 8 year old Dell Inspiron laptop back to useable life. The Dell software reinstallation CD doesnt work as it should, and the system doesnt allow you to format the HD. I ordered a HD eraser and the driver CD. They both worked wonders together!! I would recommend this product to anyone."
274515,-1.0,2018,"Just installed windows xp 64 bit pro on a Toshiba laptop, and on a hp desktop.  This disc found about half the drivers I need in each case.  Of course the ones it didn't find are for the network and Wi-Fi cards.  So I'm still pulling my hair out trying to get connected."

274520,-1.0,2018,"This product works well but, you can't use Microsoft word to open it any place else.  I had to load an old Word Program onto the new computer, copy and paste, to retrieve my work.  Thank goodness it allowed me to do that.

It did perform as indicated but other programs can not open, read or display it."
274521,1.0,2018,"I was just about ready to spend close to a $150 on a replacement office suite for my tired 2003 MS Office. I saw the ad for this $11 suite, bought it, stalled it and it is working perfectly. Reads my existing .doc and .xls files without difficulty.

So far, I've converted both Word and Excel files without any issues. At this price, what do you have to lose?"
274522,1.0,2018,"This is exactly what I needed.  So happy to be able to use this without paying a ""can't afford"" price.  Works beautifully."
274523,1.0,2018,I have an old 2007 version of the Microsoft package of programs.  This office suite 2018 works great with all my 2007 word and excel files.
274524,1.0,2018,Great for typing letters. Have not tried other funtions.

274527,1.0,2018,"Office 2018 is a nice alternative to the Microsoft Office. Not set up anywhere near Microsoft, but price wise makes a huge difference.
Still in a 'Learning Curve' but getting used to it with regular use."
274528,1.0,2018,Acts almost identical to Word. Love it.
274529,1.0,2018,Works very well and a great substitute for the more expensive product.

274551,1.0,2018,This is a much better program than microsoft's current software.
274552,1.0,2018,A very economical alternative to the price of an Office Suite but with many of the same benefits.  It comes with no installing instructions and does require some knowledge to install.
274553,-1.0,2018,Said my Windows 10 desktop had an incompatible processor and would not install.
274554,-1.0,2018,Unable to use.  No instructions.

274573,1.0,2018,Was real easy converting from Microsoft office from my desktop to this program on my laptop  that didn't have the same office product as my desktop. But! When I needed to go back to my desktop with my flashdrive it wouldn't read it. I'm still happy with your program and it is ok with me I can't use on both unless I load the program. I need my laptop more now so as long as it works on it I'm happy. It would be nice if a calculator could b added to the Excel program. And the delete feature in the Excel has to many steps. I'm glad I took the chance and ordered it.
274575,1.0,2018,Exactly what we needed for home use and at a great price too.
274576,-1.0,2018,The program on the disc is NOT what I paid for!! I'm extremely upset and want a refund or the RIGHT PROGRAM!!

This software is open source and free to anyone who is willing to take the time to download it. Plus you will get the latest version available. With this purchase you are buying the convenience of having the software burned to a CD, which is fine if that is what you need."

274606,-1.0,2018,"If the image is correct for this product - it is a copy of Libre Office, burned to a disc. Libre Office is a free software available online for download. The seller hides this fact and should be forthcoming about the brand of FREE software that they are selling."

274608,-1.0,2018,Does not work for me.
274619,-1.0,2018,"This product will not load on my computer. I get a message stating that it won't load on a 64 bit system and suggesting I return it for a different version disc. (I have a Windows 7, 64-bit system.) This is contrary to what its specs say in the product description.

This is very disappointing. Since I delayed in trying to load the disc, I probably won't bother trying to get a replacement from the Company. I'll just put the disc aside - wasted money."
274620,-1.0,2018,Could not get to load on computer. Return back to Amazon
274621,-1.0,2018,I inserted this into my computer and was never able to get it to start. I tried many different options to try and get the software to install on my computer but with no success I gave up after about an hour of effort. Sent the disk back for my refund.

Would not let me go back to the screen before if I made the wrong choice, had to reboot and start over every time. After several tries I realized my account was showing blank for password so I let it reboot and it opened up without a password. Then I got back in and changed them all. I was waiting for a screen where I could reset the password but never got there. So it does work but not the way I was expecting."
274677,1.0,2018,"This reset disk saved me a bundle of money if not a Dell desktop.  I had 2 issues in using the disk to boot my computer--one was the Dell did not want to boot from CD-DVD drive (I used a portable disk drive successfully), and the second was that some of the disk instructions in the steps did not come up as indicated (I have Windows 7 and that was a choice that did not appear in the process).  Be intuitive with the steps after it boots and then the disk works fine."

274948,1.0,2018,Excellent product to write documents with a fraction of the price.
274949,1.0,2018,Was not looking forward to spending $$$ for the Microsoft office Suite when I just need word processing or a spreadsheet sporadically for home use. I was skeptical about the product but figured Id wasted more money on worse things. I was pleasantly surprised. It opened my saved documents and spreadsheets. I think this will definitely meet my needs without the big price tag.
274950,-1.0,2018,"nothing! it doesn't have a key, I downloaded free of the internet,  since there is no key it is useless to me or anyone else, I want a complete refund with postage since it is nothing that anyone should pay for , without a key it is totally useless

Works well on line also but without funneling a bunch of money to Microsoft each year for a program that used to be standard software when you bought a computer.  I like to write stories and often I don't have internet so I needed a system that will work offline.  This is it and the price is great.

274959,1.0,2018,"Have only used it once but the Suite runs much better (so far) compared to the free downloads.  Seems to run very smothly compared tp the ""free online download"" which gave me constant problems!  Have only briefly used the word processor but it seems to work smoothly."
274960,1.0,2018,Exactly as advertised and quickly installed.
274961,1.0,2018,This is much better than buying from Microsoft and paying a monthly fee. It's all on one CD and don't need to try downloading it. Came when it was suppose to. Great product..
274962,1.0,2018,"I bought this product to use Excel and Word documents. It works great, no problems so far. Easy to use."
274963,1.0,2018,Ditch Microsoft Word NOW.  Gone are the problems associated with their computer-altering 'updates' and lousy customer service.  Perfectly satisfied with this product.
274964,1.0,2018,"The Open Office Suite 2018, do what I need to accomplish, without the larger expense. It can read my old Excel files,"
274965,1.0,2018,"Excellent substitute for the over priced Microsoft Office suite.  No problems encounter developing, sending and receiving documents and spreadsheets."
274967,-1.0,2018,Just bought a new laptop with Windows 10...this ap does not work with Windows 10. It says it does...no way!
274968,1.0,2018,Seller stands behind product. Product is opensource and free to the public. Just like windows but only better.
274969,0.0,2018,Not very user friendly . I hate having to go back to Microsoft Office . They just keep you by your throat until you have to cough up over  $300 . We need more options and they need more competition. They get you hooked then you're stuck . I'm holding out with OpenOffice as long as I can but not sure how it will work when I need to do business transaction/correspondence. I have trouble locating my documents generated with this program. .
274970,1.0,2018,I will allow my Microsoft Office subscription expire and will install this program onto my computer.
274972,1.0,2018,So far works great
274973,1.0,2018,it was software that was usable the moment you loaded it. I like it quite well!
274974,1.0,2018,works good
274975,1.0,2018,"Easy to install, works well, easy to use."
274976,1.0,2018,"I absolutely LOVE IT! It has all the functionality of the *big name product* at a mere fraction of the cost; it offers more features than the *big name product*, I can use it on multiple devices, no penalties or fines, AND I don't have to renew it every year, or buy it again every year!  It's AWESOME!!!! It has the function icons in different places than I am used to, but it's all there... everything I need and more! So SO glad I purchased this product!!!!"
274977,1.0,2018,It was easy to understand and just what I needed
274978,1.0,2018,"This was just what I was looking for without paying a monthly fee, it works good."
274979,-1.0,2018,"It said it would work with Windows 10, but on my laptop with Microsoft's windows 10 Microsoft 360 kept blocking it from installing and I had to return it."
274980,1.0,2018,"Very good for what it does, an inexpensive alternative to buying expensive software."
274981,1.0,2018,"I just love this software. I, can do everything with it as I can with Microsoft office. This software is truly compatible with Microsoft Office."
274983,1.0,2018,Loaded it onto my computer and it is just like Microsoft word system
274984,1.0,2018,"For the average user, it is essentially interchangeable with the expensive alternative."
274985,1.0,2018,Fantastic product!
274986,1.0,2018,Great alternative to Microsoft Office.  Has all the features of office without costing $$$.  Love it.
274987,1.0,2018,"Had to load it twice due to Windows problem but so far it's been great. An inexpensive alternative to Microsoft Offic,e and only pay for it once not a yearly subscription."
274988,1.0,2018,"It works! I'm a brain dead ""cornputer"" operator, but somehow I was able to put the CD in my computer and after paying a little attention it loaded up and now I can write disgusting letters and even SPELL CHECK THEM! I don't care about the rest of the stuff. You kids will have to tell how good it is, but for me, I might not even take my afternoon pills I'm SO HAPPY!"
274989,1.0,2018,Very user friendly. Great alternative to buying Microsoft Office Suite.
274991,1.0,2018,Easy to install and easy to use
274992,1.0,2018,just what I needed.
274993,-1.0,2018,don't know what this is about I didn't order this
274994,1.0,2018,"I am very happy I purchased this program. It does exactly what Word does when it comes to all functions, columns, tables, spell check. I particularly like how, with clicking an icon, I can convert to pdf.  File can be saved as a 97-2000 Word file as well.  So far, I've had no problem at all. I've had it for about 5 months now
I would highly recommend it."
274995,1.0,2018,"So happy to get!  Not Microsoft Office, but serves the same purpose.  The great part, I don't have to pay Microsoft Office $100 per year. Thanks so much!!"
274996,1.0,2018,Great product - however there is absolutely no need to purchase a CD when you can download all of this for free.
274997,1.0,2018,"Not as good as Microsoft office , but a heck of a lot cheaper  ."
274998,-1.0,2018,Don't purchase this disk. I was told by my IT guy that this type of software should be free and that it is illegal to purchase. I would like to return it if the company sees this message.
274999,1.0,2018,everything works well
275000,-1.0,2018,"The label says, compatible with Microsoft Office Word, Excel, etc.  Instead, it completely takes over  Microsoft Office.  I had to uninstall Office Suite and then go through another process to recover my documents in Word.  Very unpleasant experience."
275001,1.0,2018,I like it! It suits my needs for general things.
275002,1.0,2018,A great way to explore MS Office Suite
275003,1.0,2018,"good product, fast delivery!!"
275004,1.0,2018,"I really like using OpenOffice and for various reasons, wanted it on CD and this CD has worked out perfect for me."
275005,1.0,2018,Software does what it says. Love it! I used Win Office 365 for years and did not want to pay another license fee with them. Your software does exactly what I want to do. Thank You
275006,1.0,2018,Software is exactly what I needed.  Did the job perfectly.
275007,0.0,2018,did not meet my needs.
275008,0.0,2018,Does what I need it to do for the most part for a Word program.  Gets stuck at times when trying to cut and paste or other functions.  If I keep it real simple it works.  Reasonable cost.
275009,1.0,2018,yes it works fine.
275010,1.0,2018,Works great! I love it
275011,1.0,2018,Wonderful alternative to Microsoft's expensive programs after the fact.
275012,1.0,2018,Worked great. All I needed wae excel and I got it!
275013,-1.0,2018,"No,,not an alternative to Microsoft. It ya need to print love letters, other documents cool. But some job sites require a certain file,,and This does not upload resume's on Some sites. Nothing work like Microsoft,,,except Microsoft!!"
275014,1.0,2018,"I've had it about a week, and so far I'm pleased. The only problem is that I can't put individual selections, such as word, powerpoint, etc. on the desktop."
275015,1.0,2018,"Almost like Microsoft office, a few quirks to learn"
275016,1.0,2018,"Have not used it enough to give 5 stars, but so far it's all an average user needs for word processing, simple spreadsheets and playing around with presentations and drawing.  If you are not into super high graphics and high-end publishing, there is no need for more Even if your not into pro-publishing this will still give you a decent document with some bells and whistles."
275017,1.0,2018,I needed a program that I didn't have to be online for and this was it.
275019,1.0,2018,It works like a charm and so much cheaper that Microsoft Office.
275020,1.0,2018,An absolute great value. I was a little bit concerned if it was compatible  with excel. I have had a chance to expermint a little bit and I can't tell any difference. I wish I had known about the program a long time ago.
275021,1.0,2018,Nice alternative to MS Office. Price was very good.
275022,-1.0,2018,"This is nowhere what I wanted.  I wanted to have ""works"" and mostly able to make a database for my financial stuff.  This was horrible and not able to use at all.  It required Java which is so outdated but I did download it to see what would happen.  Finally after not being able to work with the program I gave up.  I won't be using this again.  I'm thankful it wasn't too expensive so I'm not out a lot of money.  I'll have to figure out another way to install ""Works"" and mostly the program to make a database some other way.  I have Windows 10 and Windows 10 doesn't accept lots of old programs."
275023,1.0,2018,"very good service, seems to work as good as Microsoft word, even easier in fact"
275025,1.0,2018,Installed easily. Working fine so far.
275026,1.0,2018,Program works great and very affordable.
275027,-1.0,2018,Did not work well on Windows 10. The cost was not worth the effort wasted on trying to get it to work. Save you money
275028,1.0,2018,I love that this is an option so as to not to pay monthly or for a Microsoft office suite subscription. The word program works really well. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars as I am not able to save and close a document without exiting the program.
275029,1.0,2018,Just bought a new laptop and I am happy I didn't have to pay for Microsoft. I am able to open all my docs that I transferred from old computer.
275030,1.0,2018,I think it was easy to install...any problems i had with installation was probably my fault.  It is now installed and I am happy with the results.
275031,1.0,2018,It's everything that I need at a very reasonable price.
275032,1.0,2018,Great software. Why anyone would pay for MS Office is beyond me after installing and using this. Never buying MS Office again! Great product!
275033,1.0,2018,No issues loading the software and it works as expected.
275034,-1.0,2018,loaded it on my old computer and won't work
275035,1.0,2018,Five stars for delivery and five for the product itself.
275036,1.0,2018,Does what I needed it to do and alot cheaper than Microsoft Office
275037,1.0,2018,Software works as advertised. Found it easy to use.
275038,-1.0,2018,"You guys know this is a free download right? Freeware, available on about 8 different sites for download and install..."
275039,1.0,2018,Had used this software before through employer. This 2018 version loaded just fine and so far works well. Much cheaper that buying the Microsoft suite and does everything I need to do. Thanks for the quick shipping.
275040,1.0,2018,Sent quickly - well packaged - works well .  Cost effective.  Very pleased
275041,1.0,2018,The order arrived on time and worked well when installed on my computer.
275042,1.0,2018,I like that the program spread sheet works as good as the wps program that I don't have anymore.  I'm happy with it.
275043,-1.0,2018,Ignore the single star. I post it only because I have yet to receive the CD.
275044,1.0,2018,All I need for my work
275045,1.0,2018,"I installed program with no issues, still in process of learning to use it."
275047,1.0,2018,Good. I have been looking for a simple Word Processor. Very Satisfied will recommend this product
275048,1.0,2018,"I was paying for Office when I only mostly needed word processing.  Still working my way around it...very user friendly.  Very smooth transition to include existing word documents.  I'm glad I'm free of Microsoft Office.  This is a good alternative, with capabilities that I am still learning about.  I like this software."
275049,1.0,2018,I just got mine downloaded to my computer and as far as I can tell it's pretty awesome and the price is so awesome in itself.
275050,1.0,2018,"Four stars only because my use of features is very limited, and so I cannot comment on full functionality.  That said, it has worked perfectly so far on everything I transferred from my old computer (Microsoft Office) to my new computer where I installed this product to avoid Microsoft's high price.  And, no problems with installation."
275051,1.0,2018,I believe that it will save me a lot of money and get me off the Microsoft merry-go-round.
275052,-1.0,2018,"If I could post a negative number, I would.  The software is not compatible with Microsoft Word, Excel, Publisher, etc.  Horrible.  Creating is fine, but no other program can open it.  Arghh."
275053,1.0,2018,Suggest that this disk be made available on a Flash Drive for those computers without a CD Drive. This way one can make a little profit on the flash drive.
275054,1.0,2018,Works great!  Is fully compatible with Microsoft Office as far as my needs have shown.  Fully intend on quitting my Office subscription when it comes due this year.....this appears fully functional for my use!  Can also be installed on multiple computers (don't think there is a limit).
275055,1.0,2018,"I just installed it, easy! I couldn't see paying for Microsoft office when all I use is excell and Word. It is compatible with my files and everything works! Save yourself some money!"
275056,1.0,2018,It's absolutely great.  So far I can compare it to Microsoft suite with what I used it for.  I'm happy that I purchasers it.
275057,0.0,2018,"The product seems to work well but I am unsure how to convert already existing files to pdf files.  I saved a resume on peg for pictures format and is unsure how to convert it to a pdf file, because it was originally an upload file that was saved in pictures.  Will contact seller for further assistance but everything else seemed fine."
276661,-1.0,2018,Difficult to use. Never got it to copy my old tapes to dvd. Only thing it will do easily is copy old tapes to thumb drives.
276662,1.0,2018,Easy to use.  Good transfer.  Sometimes takes long time 6-10 hrs to save edit if hr or longer video.
276663,1.0,2018,Easily converted my videotapes. I was able to quickly and easily convert whole tapes in the easy mode. I was able to  figure out the more advanced mode to edit down some of my tapes. I am a novice and simply wanted an easy method to achieve my goals.
276665,1.0,2018,Does what it should. Editing software is very very difficult and a lot impossible to figure out.
276666,-1.0,2018,Doesn't work
276667,1.0,2018,"What a great way to convert video tapes to DVD, or cassette recordings to CDs.  Save your home movies!  Easy to use!"
276668,1.0,2018,"it does exactly what it says.
I am changing old pete sampras games for VHS to DVD.
Product works really well."
276669,-1.0,2018,Couldn't get the product to work.
276670,-1.0,2018,"At first I had this connected to a spare Dell T110 running Windows Server 2016.  It installed just fine and everything seemed to work.  However, the captured video stuttered and was basically unwatchable.  I figured it was a compatibility issue with Server 2016 (their website says it's compatible with Windows 10/8/7, etc.) so I quickly reloaded Windows 10 on the machine which resulted in the same stuttering with the captured videos.

The build quality is nice and I initially had high hopes for this unit.  In the end, I yanked a Hauppauge HD PVR off of my SageTV server and used the Hauppauge video capture software to do the work (which was flawless, btw.)"
276671,1.0,2018,Great product!
276672,1.0,2018,"I love this thing. It does exactly what I needed it to, and it's very easy to use. Just make sure that you have all of the necessary cables for connecting it to your devices. What you need may not be included in this purchase, depending on how you plan to use it, so that's something to keep in mind."
276673,1.0,2018,Converted all of my VHS movies to DVD. Now i'm considering doing the same for others for $$$.
276674,1.0,2018,Easy to transfer 8mm tapes....  love.
286586,0.0,2018,Decent for price.
286587,1.0,2018,Not so easy to figure out
286588,1.0,2018,"Works great, easy to use."
286589,-1.0,2018,Buggy! Not always intuitive.
286590,1.0,2018,"Love,love , love.  We have used this to mock up our new home and that if our friends.  So simple to use and an amazing program!!!! Well worth the money plus"
286591,1.0,2018,"Great program and intuitive to use.  I designed our entire remodel project of our entertainment / home theater room, down to the location of the pool table which allowed me to plan exactly where to place the lighting."
286592,1.0,2018,"For a free/cheap software it goes really far, specially after getting all the plug-ins. The more I use it the more I like it.. Could use a update that would make raising floor levels easier.."
286593,-1.0,2018,"I is not working!!!!

I always get this message"
286594,1.0,2018,"After reading all the recent negatives I decided to go with the free version instead -- and found that it runs very well on Windows 10. The additional requirements specify it is only for some graphics cards, so if you are in doubt you may want to try the free version first. I have not yet played with all the features -- I just had one difficult room to figure out -- but I was able to get things working very easily without really looking at the instructions."
286595,1.0,2018,Great for the price!
286596,1.0,2018,Excellent program used to remodel the 2nd floor of my house. Easy to use and very complete.
286598,1.0,2018,"Just bought a new house, painted the interior and  put new hardwood floor. Sweet Home 3D was extremely useful in building the 3D model of the house, choosing the floor wood (used the custom texture feature), the color of wall paints, doors and cabinets, and virtually placing the furniture in each room. Went through a lot of iterations until both my wife and I were satisfied with the end result. Actually, extremely satisfied with the end result."
286599,-1.0,2018,"Downloaded from the SweetHome site. It will not even start up on my Windows 10. Constant error saying I have to update graphics drivers. I deleted it, Don't bother."
286600,-1.0,2018,no matter what I do the user interface is too small to read any of the words!
286601,-1.0,2018,Limited use.
286602,1.0,2018,great
286603,-1.0,2018,This doesn't work on windows 10. tried on 2 computers. waste of Money!!!
286604,-1.0,2018,"My issue is the same as others, this program will not work on Windows 10. This issue is not a Windows 10 issue or a Graphic Card issue. It is a program issue. I tried all of the ""fixes"" listed on all the forums. A big fat nope. Save your $14 until the developer gets it into gear. Windows 10 has been out for a while... I'm just saying....

It will work for a while, but after you try to modify any saved work- it crashes. Each and every wonderful time."
286605,1.0,2018,it is very accurate and flexible program to design home. There are many textures and decoration stuff. you can make wonderful  pictures.
286607,-1.0,2018,hard to work with
286608,-1.0,2018,I made a mistake and ordered the software but I have a MAC now I want to get my money back but there is no option for returns.
286609,-1.0,2018,"Doesn't work on Windows 10?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Says there is a problem with the DirectX Open GL driver. The computer is fine.  The program is the problem."
286610,1.0,2018,Its alright.
286611,1.0,2018,Overall I enjoy the software. Easy to use for the most part. Cabinet selection for the kitchen could use more or I figure out how to modify the furniture. 4 stars. Pretty good. For what I needed
286612,1.0,2018,Awesome software for the diyer that wanna plan his renovation projects!
286613,1.0,2018,Great program and it does work with windows 10
286614,-1.0,2018,"compatibility with window 10 it will run ,"
286615,-1.0,2018,i was really looking forward to using this program but Cant run the program. says fatal error directx/opengl.
286616,1.0,2018,Very nice update of an excellent interior design program.
286617,-1.0,2018,"This version does not work with Windows 10 !  It has a graphic card and Java driver update need that can not be updated or logged as updated.
 I tried and could not fix it.  I want newer software or I want my money back!"
286618,1.0,2018,"I've used Sweet Home 3D to create an image of our entire home that we're about to remodel top to bottom. I'd tried a couple of other programs first and, although I'm pretty experienced with software, found they took more effort to learn than I was willing to put in when I was using them only temporarily, for one specific project. I wanted a program that I could learn in a few minutes, and Sweet Home 3D is definitely that! There's great user information online to get you started, and from then on it's very intuitive. I love the split-screen feature: you build your plan in the upper window (floor plan view) and every addition and change shows up immediately in the lower window (3D image). Compared to some other programs, there's perhaps a more limited number of items to add to your plan (furniture, fixtures, window and door types, etc), but that's appropriate for a simple program: you don't have to sort through a lot of options to find something that expresses your vision. The items that are available can easily be customized for size, color, texture, etc.. I also like that I can export my designs in various file types, including one that a designer or architect can read in their professional CAD software, so I can hand my sketch off to the pros who can fill in the details. This program has helped immensely with our planning and visioning."
286619,1.0,2018,This was great
286620,-1.0,2018,Does not work on Windows 10.
286621,1.0,2018,great software for basic planning. Use friendly interface in 3D.May be an update on furniture would be an asset
286622,0.0,2018,"I just began to use it. It seems simple to work with, the least, I don't know yet."
286623,1.0,2018,"I've grown to love Sweet Home 3D over the years.  I discovered it by chance years ago in a SUSE Linux repo, although I hadn't any application for it at the time.  Does it stand up to dedicated applications like Sketch, Corel or AutoDesk?  No, not by a long shot.  For those of us who aren't working as architects or mechanical engineers, however, this software can do some pretty amazing things!  I've used it for simple floor plans, landscape design, interior design mock-ups, even for creating a simple 3D intro video for a website!

The bottom line: With a very minor learning curve and a bit of creativity, you're very likely to find multiple uses for this program.  It's (relatively) lightweight, and quite honestly pretty darn fun to use once you get the hang of it.  Sure, you can get an almost identical version for free, but I have no regrets supporting the developers, especially since there's no question I've gotten my money's value worth ten-fold."
286624,1.0,2018,I have been drawing and redrawing my dream house for many years. I have used several different programs and found it is easy to use if you have a little knowledge of computers.
286625,1.0,2018,for a full purchased copy I would have liked to see a more professional lay out. Make items easier to find then just scrolling threw the lists.
286626,1.0,2018,Perfect for designing and getting a good view of what a 3D representation would look like at same time.
286627,1.0,2018,The software is what I expected.  Needed something to bring my blueprints to life of my house we are building.  The UI takes a little getting used to but did what I needed.
286628,0.0,2018,"This is a great bit of software.
While fairly complicated by ignorance of the user interface - there are plenty of videos on Youtube to show you how to do things.

My personal thoughts at the moment are that it's not so intuitive or slightly limited as I yet can't put down the home I've designed in it.
But for what I have learned to use so far - I find it interesting and pretty good."
286629,1.0,2018,"No doubt, it is the coolest software which is offered for free. But I felt the paid version would contain more inbuilt objects, other than the CC and CCby, which are any way in the download section of Sweethome3d. But I guess all of them are packed into one installation in paid version. Nevertheless, the developer requires support from people. So no regret!"
286630,1.0,2018,Would be great if we can open and close doors on 3D view!
286631,-1.0,2018,"this program is absolute garbage...for example, something as simple as changing wall colors doesnt work; textures won't change colors and so on. this is a VERY blunt instrument. nuanced looks cannot be achieved. i work every day with complex design software.  this software is a STIFF!!!! skip it"
286632,1.0,2018,i love it.. thank you
286633,1.0,2018,Fun software. Used it to show my wife how our new entertainment center will fill a corner after I finish building it.
286634,-1.0,2018,It does not run on windows 10.
286635,1.0,2018,Not sure why its not working on some Windows 10 pcs but it's working fine on mine.  This is a really good program once you learn it.  Like anything there is a learning curve but once you get past that it's a really great program for the price for sure. I'm about 2/3 of the way done mopping my whole house out and I really enjoy it. Glad I bought it.
286636,1.0,2018,I purchased the full version to help with redesigning my house. Its pretty easy to get the hang of. It has really helped me to get my ideas to the builder.
286637,-1.0,2018,This software does not run on Windows 10. Too bad....
286638,1.0,2018,Excelente

286642,-1.0,2018,I can not download this app and there is a no return policy. It is quite complicated to figure out what needs to be changed in your computer so that you don't get an error when you try to open the app. It is wasted dollars. Don't buy! You will not know if it will work until you pay and then the problems occur. It will be a problem with your computer but you won't know how to fix it.  A bit of a scam.

289576,-1.0,2018,"I regret this purchase more than I regret not using a sunscreen in my youth.  I have had Paintshop Pro for years and wanted to venture into painting.
 I excitedly found PE5 and, without any research, impulsively purchased it.

I believed the hype from Corel that this was a better version of PE4.  Since I had never seen  or used 4, what's not to believe?

I had so many problems with 5 that I searched and found a help forum for PE to get some pointers.  What I discovered from the members is that 5 might have tires but they are bald and it doesn't have an engine.  It looks to me like Corel ruined PE with this version.  Why they did this is beyond me. I downloaded a free trial of PE4 and was amazed at the choices and options. It's much friendlier to use, the interface is superb and the quality renditions are an artist's dream come true.  I found a copy for $9.99 on Amazon and ordered it.

The PE5 disc is now a drink coaster.

In short, if you have 4, stay with it.  You have been warned."

(Over inflated price and too many extra fluff and hassle with proprietary software)  Excited to find this. The reviews I read were irrelevant to those who are not Excel users. Not intuitive? Of course not! I wouldn't expect it be. I'll repost another review once I try it and see if it meets my expectation and needs. Anyone like it enough to actually purchase the full version?

303998,-1.0,2018,"So if you want to read books on your PC or Windows Tablet, look elsewhere.  This is a real crime.  The software is really clunky.  The experience is not very smooth.  Reading is not bad but the library interface is slow to respond.  It seems to crawl to a stop when a title is downloading. As for the reading view you really need to tweak the settings to get anything close to acceptable. (the last screen shot on this post is the initial view that you are presented with for your first read)  The Dark Theme is only half complete the toolbars remain a blinding concrete grey, when the dark mode is turned on.  There is an attempt to make this look like modern software but it is at best a half effort.  Menus styles remain stuck in 2001 and are completely distracting to a good read.  At least the full screen mode can be used to hide these two errors while reading.  Another thing that I don't like is that the Top and Bottom margins are pretty small.  As a result the sheer amount of text on the screen is way too much for my taste. I would increase the Top and Bottom margins to create some breathing room, if I could.  I have no idea how this represents a better reading experience than the former windows store application.  This is a poor attempt and really a sub par reading experience.  I will keep getting my digital books from other sources."

304031,1.0,2018,"I have Kindle Unlimited and I've used this app so much it's a wonder they don't levy an extra charge. It's free to download to your laptop or PC. Occasionally it will balk at deleting something when using the Content and Devices tool to return books. I find that a week or so later the lagging book will disappear during another synch. There's some mystery key combination I hit randomly that causes it to go to the two page layout, which shrinks my text back from 14-point font and drives me crazy. Other than that, this works better than 99% of software releases I've paid good money for. And you get to read free books. What's not to love? Just wish it had a way to lock preferred settings to avoid problems originating between the keyboard and the chair :) I love me some hardcover books, and I was initially dubious about reading a book on my computer screen. Now that I can download books, read and return them whenever I want, I'm sold."

The lack of indicators on the book lists when you have the Audible version of the book as well as the ebook is annoying but also an issue for the dedicated Kindle reader I have (the Paperwhite).

This version fails to sync more often than the other versions of the reader in my experience with it. .

If I were to rank them, I'd put the Apple IOS versions first as they show which titles I have in audio format, then the Kindle Paperwhite version next as the device can be used a very long time between charges and finally the PC version. For straight reading, it's okay as are all the various readers I've used."

Not the books in the entire library, not the contents of collections, the actual list of collections. My (now dead) Android device did this automatically, so obviously the Kindle team knows how to do it.
I've finally sent email directly to Jeff Bezos requesting the ability to alphabetize the list of collections. More news when I have it.

Well, downloaded the latest version from the MacApp store. I tried to save the previous version, but the new version deleted it. The new version deleted ALL MY COLLECTIONS as well as ""unownIoaded"" a number of my books. I am now furious."

304091,-1.0,2018,"I am a Master's student who recently bought 2 ebooks for Kindle on Amazon, and I was very disappointed to realize that there are some serious limitations concerning the amount of content that I can highlight and copy from each book. I am writing my thesis and this is no luxury: I have to take notes, build summaries and create quotation banks while I am reading. Nothing new here... this is how building a literature review works. However, I am only 60% through the first book and I can no longer copy passages. There was no warning before I bought the books so I was expecting a full access to the content. It is very frustrating. I have payed for these books. It's not like I was trying to copy/paste anything illegally... Next time I will simply buy a good old hard copy and type the passages myself. This application may be fine for those who read for leasure, but students, teachers, researchers and academics in general may find this limitation very frustrating."

When reading for a long time, (on a backlit screen) I like to read somewhat dimmed text on a dark background. and nothing else on the screen.
the oversized, mostly empty tool bars cannot be hidden from view, or even dimmed.
they waste screen space, (ruin an otherwise perfect aspect ratio for two page layout)
and are much brighter than the black background and text i'm trying to focus on.
I'm trying to read with a light shining in my face.
I'm shocked that TRUE fullscreen is STILL not an option.

On iphone you can choose to hide *everything* extra.  Why not on macOS ??
iBooks does full screen, even Kindle Cloud Reader can do proper full screen!!

I have taken a picture of what it looks like on a computer for with Windows 10. Bland, unimpressive. It works, but that is it.

Unless I'm misunderstanding, there is an additional charge if you want to listen with the kindle app.  That's a downer, must be a way to get more people to try Audiobook which turns out to be cheaper per book, but would rather not have 2 apps for books. I called customer service to clarify this but could not understand the woman who was trying to explain (English is not their first language and they both had heavy accents) and she did not seem to understand my question so I gave up.

Anybody want to clarify????  If you want to listen to books with kindle you pay for the book then an additional charge for whisper sync to listen to a book?"

If you don't want to read on the cloud, you can change this option below the buying options *before* you click the 1-Click ordering button...make sure the Kindle App is running *first* and then your book will show up only a moment after you purchase it!

If you've already purchased books and didn't realize the ""deliver to..."" button was there, you can go to your ""Orders"" page and click ""Kindle"" to see all the digital books you've bought and check off and download any of them. You'll never lose a book because you can donwload it again!

I notice a ""Sync"" button, but I do not recommend using it...it may create problems if your account gets deleted for any reason or you lose access to it.

It also has a built-in reader. However, a prefer Calibre for converting, organizing, tagging, and reading eBooks (including other formats than Amazon's)."

304275,1.0,2018,I enjoy reading Kindle books on my PC.
304279,-1.0,2018,"This is a horrible app. The previous version for Windows 8 and 10 was so much better and gave you the appearance of reading a book on a 2 n 1 laptop/tablet. Now it just feels like I'm reading in an app. And try using this thing when on a plane.

Just horrible! Worse, other apps would require me to purchase books I already own because Amazon refuses to let people tie in to apps that actually work."
304281,1.0,2018,Huge choice of books for good cost.
304282,1.0,2018,I love my Kindle for PC and have hundreds of books on it!
304283,1.0,2018,"Works great! I downloaded this on my Surface Pro 3. I have only used it for one book (a required book for a course), and it worked out wonderfully! I was able to pull it up easily and read it perfectly! The only problem for me was the fact that I had to keep scrolling and scrolling for a desired page. However, I was able to access my book without any difficult and it convenient."
304284,-1.0,2018,I Installed the app and it crashed my laptop and I couldn't get into my start menu. After trying to fix the problem I had to reinstalled my windows. I am not happy about this app at all.

304291,1.0,2018,"I love being able to simply download a book and start reading. I also appreciate that I can make the pages sepia-colored, much easier on the eyes. Plus, the books on Bookbud flow easily into the Kindle. Very happy with Kindle for Mac."
304292,1.0,2018,"Really enjoy this app! I wish we had page numbers instead of locations, because we use page numbers in class (for when I use textbooks), but for leisure reading, it's perfect. The pages are easy to read, the highlighting features are very helpfully and it works quickly."
304293,1.0,2018,Good reader!
304294,1.0,2018,Enables me to read on a bigger screen than my Kindle Device which really helps when my eyes are tired or blurry.

304307,-1.0,2018,"The kindle application won't load some of my most important texts. I tried deleting and reloading them, but they still didn't open. The cloud reader indicates that you can't read them from the cloud reader and directs you to use the desktop app. The desktop application simply doesn't work though."
304308,-1.0,2018,"I could not make it work. I followed the troubleshooting instructions, but it still won't work."
304309,0.0,2018,"Kindle is ok, but really sucks for music transcription.  On a PC is so tiny.  The only way to enlarge is to double click twice to make it bigger (there no button for that), plus you can't turn the page when it's enlarged. So you have to exit out every time you need to turn the page.  I'll find alternatives in the future."
304310,0.0,2018,"Works as expected.  I am not a fan of proprietary readers, but it was the only way to access the online versions of a couple of books I wanted to read in my down time."

304323,1.0,2018,"Works well enough, on everything from a cheapo tablet to a full-sized desktop. Even got a Windows Phone version for the old beast."
304324,1.0,2018,"Kindle for PC is better than I expected it to be. My wife has a Kindle and I like my Kindle for PC more. Being on a PC it seems to be more powerful and I have a better connection to Amazon when I want to get a new book.  I also have a 24 inch monitor so I see more of the book at one time and can make the font as big as I need it.

If you want a complaint all I can say is that my PC (a desktop PC) is not quite as portable as a Kindle. And I would need a really long cord. But that is okay because I also have Kindle on my smart phone."
304326,1.0,2018,Okay application.
304327,-1.0,2018,TERRIBLE for navigation for learning. And why would you read a book on the PC unless you were learning something. I don't like that it doesn't let me see the start and end of the page I'm on so I know I've gone to the next page when navigate there. The copy interface is horrible. No useful keyboard shortcuts. Super crappy
304328,0.0,2018,"I really don't like it, because I cannot use Text To Speech with it, but I don't want to give it less than three stars, because it is a nice program. I much prefer Bookshelf from Vital Source for eReader. But Amazon is such a great company--I'm sure they will improve the Kindle for PC!"
304329,1.0,2018,What else can be said? Everyone needs to have this on their computer!!
304330,1.0,2018,Great App and great reading source
304331,1.0,2018,I down loaded so we can read on any screen
304332,1.0,2018,"At the tender age of seventy, it is much easier to view books on my monitor. Additionally, if I am using a book for research it makes it so much easier to copy material to my Mac for future reference. Smooth download and my library instantly pops up on my screen when I open the Kindle App."
304333,0.0,2018,Doesn't work on iPad 2
304335,-1.0,2018,Magazines will not work on Imac
304336,1.0,2018,Works like a charm!
304337,1.0,2018,Excellent product and works great. Downloaded all my books rapidly and easy access
304338,1.0,2018,"I love being able to read my books on my computer or phone.  The only problem is that my first Kindle died, so I got another.  Which I dropped and smashed the screen, so I got another.  Which just turned off one day and wouldn't come back on.  So, I got another.  My old computer died, so I got another laptop.  When I tried to put this app on my new computer the screen told me I had too many downloaded.  I'm not sure how to get rid of my old downloads because, when I bought my final Kindle Amazon called it my 2nd Kindle, which I had already thrown away.  Now I'm not sure which download to cancel."
304339,-1.0,2018,This will not open or eject and my old Kindle was also not working on my Mac
304340,1.0,2018,Works well. Very few D A O issues
304341,1.0,2018,The convenience of havin it on my desktop
304342,-1.0,2018,Though I was told to download this program by 3 separate Amazom employees it did not work on my Surface. Very unhappy with Amazom overall and rarely find resolution to my issues other than one person that really went above and beyond when I was being charged for videos that I was supposed to have access too.
304343,1.0,2018,works great I have been reading again now that I can see the type and this has the ability to adjust font sizes.  I am greatly pleased.  And the price is awesome.
304344,1.0,2018,I can always have my books with me
304345,1.0,2018,AAA+++
304346,1.0,2018,What is there to say? It downloaded and installed with no problem.
304347,1.0,2018,Works great but I can't swap dictionaries.  If they would fix that it would be as good as the standalone Kindle.  I use the Kindle to practice Spanish and the one way dictionary it uses is a little limited. Highlighting a word and getting the English translation is very helpful. You could use Google and jump out of the program but that is not a good solution since it breaks your train of thought.
304348,0.0,2018,This is for every kindle app. They don't synchronized together like they should. If you upload a book for example on the pc and start reading what you expect is to continue reading on another decive. Or at least that would be the best thing you could try to do.
304349,1.0,2018,Love it
304350,1.0,2018,It didn't really have the download!
304352,1.0,2018,It works very well.
304353,-1.0,2018,"I bought a music book that has an audio component. I had to download the audio separately. It's 2018. Multimedia should be incorporated into the eBook. The app works fine, but I had to turn off the notifications as there are way too many."
304354,-1.0,2018,"The Kindle AP for iPad Deserves zero stars.  There is no way to navigate if you are in a book.  Cannot get back to the beginning or to a table of contents or switch books.  Cannot  sort books by reader, and a home screen should list readers and THEN load their library.  Sucks big time."
304355,1.0,2018,I love the app. What's to say

304360,1.0,2018,Use this daily and it works well for reading e-books.
304361,-1.0,2018,"Text-to-speech is awful.  It is extremely slow, and there are no easy ways to make adjustments to the speed of it.  I am a doctoral student and have been using a PDF text-to-speech reader for dense academic journal articles, which has improved the rate that I read them, as well as my retention, tremendously.  I thought buying and reading a textbook in electronic format would be just as efficient, but instead it's unusable.  Since the Kindle return policy is only 7 days, which I wasn't aware of, I can't refund it (it's only been 11 days).  Now I will have to pay double for the same book in physical format."
304364,1.0,2018,It's a kindle reader. I use it to read. It works great.

Your savings on digital books over paper books is outstanding and even better I can order on demand and have it in MINUTES!

Amazon has a great collection that is available and most of their reviews are dead on. Love it!"

Now I cannot read my music books anymore. The music sheets are way too small and no way to zoom in on them. Every single app I have has this function. It is an absurd that Amazon did not add it, there are complains from 2013 about this and still have not be fixed it. Instead they ask us to send a feedback to every single publisher about the format of the images. An absurd. I will ask for a refund for every single book I purchased and I will buy the nook version of them."

304453,-1.0,2018,"It is a disappointment to find that the Kindle for PC doesn't accommodate Amazon Business Accounts. We thought it was our PCs and Macs, but after communicating with the online chat representative it turns out that Kindle for PC doesn't allow seamless log in for Amazon Business Accounts as it does from an Amazon personal account (which by the way did actually did work).

It would get zero stars but that is not an option. So let it be said that the one star is because it at least works for personal accounts. Although if you're looking to have it read you audio, you will need to see how to rig that up in your computer or better yet just sync your phone / tablet with the Kindle App to a Bluetooth speaker and scrap the use of the PC download all together.

comp735 LLC. utilizes Kindle to do book reviews on Kindle and Audible books, so we're not interested in having 2 Kindle Unlimited subscriptions (one business; one personal)  just so that the PC download can be utilized. For all the technological brainiac ideas this company has. It's a shame that the long thought after the fantastic short thought of having a great option like Amazon Business, falls so short of expectation.

Once someone contacts us to let us know that you have corrected this we will try this out and see if it is worth adding any more stars to the review. For now it's a fail."

The book page loads immediately and fits perfectly on my screen with easy page turn forward or backward.

I spent a half hour in a chat window with an Amazon rep today. Their comment was maybe the next version will fix it?!  My bet is it will continue to get worse.

The speed control on the reader had no speed control and the new update had the speed of the reader turned all the way up. So, after calling Kindle they mailed me the setting that were not added in the help section or any section of the Application. Enclosed are the manual controls one can use from the keyboard.

304553,-1.0,2018,"If you are using this app, there is one very important note.  To make it usable, you must hover over the edge of the reading area to make it wider.  If you don't, as other reviews have pointed out, the reading area only covers 1/3 of the screen.  This is not at all obvious.  I am still very disappointed with the quality of this app but at least I have come off the cliff.  I was infuriated for about 20 minutes until my wife saw the cursor change.  I am quite surprised that Amazon would put out such a poorly designed program.  It has certainly shaken my confidence in their commitment to their customers."

304555,1.0,2018,Awesome app! Easy to use with great features. Maybe I missed it but can't seem to locate a function that increases page size to read some diagrams. This would be an excellent feature to include in an already great product.

304670,-1.0,2018,"I normally try to avoid being rude, but this app is ridiculously useless. The only thing I liked is my book covers are bigger on my laptop than my Kindle 10.

It gives you the option to import collections, yet it won't allow you to import collections.  But, when you contact customer service for assistance, you are told that the option to import collections does not work in the app for the PC. When you ask why Amazon can't get the Kindle app for the PC to work with collections, but the Kindle app for my android has my collections and it syncs with my Fire 10, you get ""I will pass it along to our developers"".

I am not a developer. My question is, can the developers who work on the app for Android and iPhone, get together with the developers that work on the app for the PC for Windows 10, and figure out something?  Every time I upgrade my OS, I download the Kindle app, expecting it to be better and it never really gets better.  I don't understand why.  I guess I expected more from Amazon.  I don't HAVE to use this app.  The one on my phone works fine, and I have my Fire.  It is so disappointing that they can't do any better. Maybe others have more success than me with the Windows app for PC.

Actually, I also kind of miss the carousel  feature they had included with my Windows 8 laptop.  That proved to be a lifesaver for me.  I have a ton of books, and had to do a hard reset on my Fire once.  It wiped out everything I had set up. I was able to recreate my TBR list because of the carousel on my laptop.  Maybe one day I will get both the carousel, and my Collections will sync."
304671,1.0,2018,I like the kindle reader much better than ebook or overdrive.  It seems more intuitive to use and book like when I'm reading.

304675,1.0,2018,"To the development team.

When using Text-to-Speech, would you please change how the ""Read the previous sentence"" (Ctrl, Shift, Up arrow) keyboard shortcut behaves. Currently when I am reading a sentence and use the shortcut, it doesn't skip to the beginning of the current sentence I am reading, instead, it skips to the beginning of the sentence prior to the current sentence.

Also, would you make an option to choose whether the mentioned shortcut skips sentences or paragraphs. I would prefer to skip forwards/backwards by paragraphs, not sentences.

Kind regards."

After a 2 hour phone session with Kindle support yesterday, we concluded there was no immediate solution to getting my Kindle software to register to my Amazon account.  So we'll wait for the Kindle software update to remedy this, or the Windows update to solve their abandonment of Amazon. Meanwhile the Amazon Cloud feature will allow anyone to read their books outside the Kindle app."
304723,1.0,2018,"I am on the go and although I love to read, I don't seem to have the time.  By loading a Kindle book to my lap top and mobile phone I can read anywhere during downtime...doctor's office visits, after lunch, etc. I have also joined Audible, but I am a bit confused at the link between a book that has a computer talking and the human reader version. I would like to be able to sync the books I purchase with both human audible texts and reading the books.  This would add an additional feature of being able to pick up where I left off reading the book and being able to listen to the book in the car."

305113,1.0,2018,really good application. thank you
305114,1.0,2018,"It is available instantaneously. I am studying for a course online, and live in Africa, so time to book availability was of essence. I also loved the platform, as it is available across many devices, is versatile and not cluttered in the interface. Only challenge is some books download so not able to see page number on the final product nor does the interface show which page. This is tricky when asked to read specific page numbers."
305115,0.0,2018,Just not bad.
305116,1.0,2018,Great app.
305117,-1.0,2018,I give it a star because it loads books and displays them. But that's where the features end. Aside from being generally clunky to interface with... The worst feature by far is the big gray bars in full screen mode. They take up half the screen and make books very hard to read.
305128,1.0,2018,I really enjoy everything I've been downloading. I haven't thought that having audio with these books would be so enjoyable. I can't understand why some of the series of books I download doesn't have audio but the rest do. I always download books that have series of 3 or more and some of the series of books maybe 1 to 2 books doesn't have audio and can't see where I can download audio to them.
305129,-1.0,2018,"It did not work.  It said that it was not available in my country, but it is available in my country but cannot be gifted."
305130,1.0,2018,OK

305132,0.0,2018,Great that we can download this free app from Amazon. Dislike the fact that I can not open the kindle app on my PC.
305133,1.0,2018,"After my $200.00, 2 year old Kindle Voyager abruptly died, I decided to read on my laptops instead of throwing away another 200 bucks.  APP works great."
305134,1.0,2018,"There are three things I love most about the Kindle PC: accessibility of documents; ability to highlight and makes notes; and how I can continue where I left off, no matter which device I use."
305135,1.0,2018,Kindle for PC is awesome!
305136,1.0,2018,Love kindle

305148,1.0,2018,Easy to follow reading ebooks and noted.
305149,-1.0,2018,"I have Kindle on my iphone and love it. So I downloaded the kindle for PC (windows 10) and it is very limited. I had an earlier version on my PC a couple years ago and it had scroll bars (which windows 10 version does not.) On my iphone I can click on a page and slide through all the pages (forward or backward) looking for something while not loosing my current page and it is not necessary to use a book mark to do this. It is a very useful feature.
Because of my Iphone version, I am very dissatisfied with the PC version."
305150,-1.0,2018,it didn't download properly. kept saying it wasn't there so I deleted it if you can tell me how to download properly I will do it. I want it
305151,1.0,2018,"Connie Wren is a true Southern Belle who was born and raised from McComb Mississippi. Wrens life experiences were the inspiration behind her book, The Long Road Home to Me. Small insignificant items, such as the skeleton key, stormy days, homes where shes lived in the past has all influenced her life in some form or shape. Every insignificant item played a key factor into the struggles and life experiences she had to overcome. Those memories still haunt her, so her therapeutic approach was to write about them. She wrote them, then compiled her short stories, poems, and influential quotes into her work, The Long Road Home to Me.
 In the introduction, Wren expressed the troubles life has casted upon her that inspired her to write and publish her works. There is a picture of a black raven that is portrayed in the beginning of the book, and the significance is due to Poes poem, The Raven. Connie Wren expressed how this became one of her favorite poems and this poem influenced her to write her own poetry (The Long Road Home to Me, 1).
 Along with her compilation of poems, she has written short stories to tell about how the poem came to be in existence. She explained of several, tragic events that left her dealing with her emotions and how she found strength because of those tragic events happening to her. Connie Wren explained her struggles, or memories that influenced her to write specific poems. She found her husband dead, she beat cancer twice, she got remarried, then divorced and while he found another lover, she is still on the search for her true love. It was Wrens tragic events, irreplaceable memories, and insignificant items that influenced her, inspired her, and that contributed to her published works. She expressed her pain she felt when a tragic event happened, such as a lovers betrayal. She explained her precious memories that shaped her into the person she is today, and why she loves the number 13, or why she keeps small items close to her heart, such as a skeleton key.
 The poem I personally felt connected to was Slow Dance. It is a poem about her own memory with her ex-lover. She dreams of the past and becomes very sadden, because there is no future. How could something so damn beautiful just end? (The Long Road Home to Me, 19). A Lovers Betrayal and the poem itself was just so damn beautiful, but all beautiful things must come to an end. All beautiful things must come to an end, and that realization is more heart breaking than something beautiful, itself, coming to an end.
 I would recommend this book to a lover of poetry. I would recommend this book to a young girl who has encountered a bad boyfriend. These poems make the reader reflect on events anybody can relate to. After reading all her poems, I have realized that I don't believe Connie Wren misses her ex, because he was always casting blame, flaws, and faults onto Connie. I personally believe that Connie just misses the actions and daily routine she had became accustomed to with her ex-lover. Either way her poetry and written works have proven her to be a lot stronger than she thought she was. Her events and ex-lover are the reasons she was able to find her own path, back to herself. That is what influences the title. It is the significance of her trouble pasts, broken hearts, and overcoming the shadows that attempted to constrain Connie that led her on a path back to herself."

305189,1.0,2018,"So easy to read anywhere. I can use it on my work computer for research, at home on my kindle for bedtime, and on my phone during train commutes."
305190,1.0,2018,good book reader
305191,1.0,2018,Its ok product
305192,-1.0,2018,"Amazon really needs to port this app to Linux. Linux commands 3% of the desktop market, and that seems unimportant. But it is a highly tech-savvy group, and the number is growing rapidly, and it is much higher in developing nations and their educational institutions. These days porting to Linux is relatively easy, and it would be a positive step toward helping those who so badly need education but can't afford proprietary channels. As such, it also would prove to be a smart business move.

For those who can find it, previous versions of KindlePC do work on Linux. For how long, I can't say. And that fact gives me hesitation to buy more kindle resources.

I left Windows 3 years ago for the world of Linux, and am so pleased with it I intend on never going back to the former bondage."
305193,-1.0,2018,I could not get it to work on my tablet/computer.
305194,1.0,2018,Great for my phone and pc.
305195,1.0,2018,Exactly as advertised.
305196,1.0,2018,"Downloaded books auto-arrange depending on what is the latest read. Not a helpful feature when one needs to categorize items per field of interest. Hard to go to page of choice. Its a 4 star  overall since it gives a clear reading,  it is efficient enough and it's free. So far it is the better one there is."
305197,1.0,2018,Good!
305198,1.0,2018,It worked beautifully so that I could read a book that was downloaded as MOBI but I was unable to e-mail it to my Kindle account.  Thanks for providing this app!

305200,1.0,2018,Good

305202,-1.0,2018,"This used to work on my PC, but since it recently updated, it will no longer open. I've tried to re-download it several times to no avail.  I went to chat support and they told me there was no recent update.  Seriously.  I opened my laptop and guess what?  It updated.  I have a screen shot as well, of the recent update. If the chat representatives don't know how to assist, they should transfer you to someone who does.  Still can't get it to download to my PC.  I wish there was a way to bring back the previous version.  At least, it worked."
305203,1.0,2018,Works well for PDFs on Windows 10.
305204,1.0,2018,"As expected - what can I say besides ""Yes it is a book"" - you read it - nice! Thank you for the free book"
305205,0.0,2018,I expected much more specially about battery life. Could  be  much more cheaper for what it delivers
305206,1.0,2018,this app is so convenient and very easy to use. I loved it.
305207,1.0,2018,"I love that it syncs my laptop and mobile phone apps so I can pick up where I left off on any device :)  It's easy to read, highlight and keep organized."
305228,0.0,2018,What I would like least was I could still not print not copy it.
305229,1.0,2018,"Kindle for PC  is in fact an app. It implies that every document, file, or even pdf book you have (on your own),  just by clicking on it you can send it immediately to your kindle. In this sense, I think it is really great.  It is also quite intuitive."
305230,0.0,2018,Does not go to full screen
305231,1.0,2018,a bit slow in loading but very good.
305232,1.0,2018,Love it!
305233,-1.0,2018,"This app drives me nuts, whether on PC or iPad.  It's good if all you want to read is unformatted text, but not good for much beyond that. Unfortunately I bought a bunch of books with Kindle, so I can't escape it.

It would seem the Kindle designers have never looked at a PDF or Word doc?  Or perhaps they studied the most unappealing ways to present material?

Chief gripes:
*  It butchers the formatting of tables
*  List formatting is unintelligible
*  Indents don't really work
*  It butchers pictures (and doesn't display many)
*  Font choices are horrible
*  Column layout is horrible -- either ""auto"" or ""single"", and ""auto"" makes bad choices
*  Finding your place in a doc is pretty horrible -- no page numbers and going to the Kindle location reformats page randomly (so you can't flip back & forth easily and know where you are in the document)
*  Cut and paste doesn't work, especially with lists (butchers formatting completely)"
305234,1.0,2018,very easy to download and instal
305235,-1.0,2018,I find it frustrating as previous downloaded books I am unable access. This is most disappointing and I have stopped buying kindle books.

305253,1.0,2018,"I also have Nook app because there are eBook's not available on kindle and I'm an avid reader. The Kindle app is superior to the Nook app in all ways but one. The Nook app lets me store it and the associated eBook's on my SD card whereas the Kindle app does not, taking up valuable internal memory. Still It is much better than the Nook app. if it and eBook's could be moved to SD card it would rate 5 Stars"

When the netbook quit working properly and I switched to this laptop, I missed my Kindle for PC.

It has even included my former library, along with a few new books I've acquired. I'm very pleased."
305282,1.0,2018,It works
305283,0.0,2018,"I downloaded this thinking that I would have access to all my content, including magazines. I was very surprised when I could not access the magazines. Now maybe I'm a dunderhead and just cannot figure it out but I can't find any way to access magazines, which really diminishes the utility of the AP."
305284,1.0,2018,always works well and is easy to use.
305285,0.0,2018,"I used Kindle for several years to keep my technical books and journals for the mobility convenience.  I would give it the 5-star rating.  Amazon-prime will not recognize my long term log in and I am having to re-purchase the needed volumes.  Amazon Help is like talking to a group of 5th graders...all very pleasant, somewhat knowledgeable, but cannot or do not know how to resolve the problem.  They send nice letters that are basic boiler Plate.  The many offers to help simply show that they do not have the ability to see the history of your problem which indicates a very low concern for customer needs.  I gave 3-stars because Amazon Prime does work.  It just is not right to make me repurchase product just because you moved the books to a different shelf! I am running A XPS-18 with Windows 10."

305301,1.0,2018,"I so much easier to have this downloaded onto one of three laptops I have, and to have the time and space, so that while I'm working on one laptop, this is running on my other one. The third one stays busy and I am not the only one who uses it."

305454,1.0,2018,Enjoy being able to use Kindle for PC on my computer. This allows me to continue with novels and instruction books wherever I am.
305455,-1.0,2018,Often times hard to scroll on my non Kindle tablet. Won't load PDF though app keeps promoting you to do so. Can only load Amazon purchased ebooks and I wanted to be able to upload author galleys and ARC for editing and proofreading.
305456,-1.0,2018,This does not have page numbers. How can you use a book for research if it does not include page numbers? I wasted $50 on this and now have to buy the hardcover.
305457,1.0,2018,Kindle for PC works perfectly. I've got no problems with it!
305458,1.0,2018,love it!
305459,0.0,2018,Neutral review for this as I don't use it much. It works as intended but I'm not much of a reader and this didn't change that.
305460,1.0,2018,"Anything by Keith Cunningham Is really good. He is a real Entrepreneur with Real World Experience as well as the education to back it up. His Business Classes drastically improved my business acumen. Especially with regards to how to read financial statements and how they relate to each other. I recommend reading any of his books and taking his courses as well. Game changer.

305461,-1.0,2018,"If you are just reading a book, then I don't have a problem with it. If you are trying to put your books into a collection, then no it doesn't work well. I have a lot of books that i have bought and when I had to re download the app, my collections went away. Trying to organize them into collections now causes the app to stop working and shut down. Like about 25+ times and i'm not even through 1/4 of my books. Please fix this because its very frustrating to restart the app and try and figure out where you stopped at and then keep going."
305462,1.0,2018,Works great to read digital book in PC
305464,1.0,2018,Don't know what I'd do with my Kindle app!
305465,1.0,2018,I am still learning my way around my Kindle for PC App. Looks like I will have an opportunity to do a lot of reading using this app. The brick and mortar library is usually closed by the time I decide that I want to read a book.
305466,1.0,2018,Love it!  I can read on my laptop and enjoy larger print.
305467,1.0,2018,"I have the PC Kindle, the Android Kindle, and the first gen Kindle paperwhite.  They all sync together, after a few seconds, flawlessly.  I love the ability to customize the appearance of the text and the other features of the app on whatever device I choose to use."

305520,1.0,2018,"This is a great book and one I will keep on my bookshelf along side some of the greatest books I've ever read.  I've known Ryan Peterson for several years now and when I found out he and Ryan Heath were publishing a book on money and how to use it properly to create a better life, I was a buyer!  That said; I wouldn't give them a 5-star review if I truly didn't think this book would change your life. I sat down today and read most of the book and was blown away.  I'll finish reading it over the next few days.  I'll likely read it again in 6 months as a refresher.  As someone who knows Ryan P personally and professionally, I would testify under oath that he's an amazing guy and the real deal.  Life is short and precious and every minute counts.  Don't waste time wondering if it's worth purchasing...do it.  You won't be disappointed."

305524,1.0,2018,Takes a little to get use to Have to call for support when trying to update book download
305525,-1.0,2018,"Awful UI and reading experience. I installed on a surface tablet and the actual reading area is a narrow column that uses very little available screen real-estate. My thought was, ""They are so desperate to get me to buy a Kindle that they won't let me have a good experience on my Surface tablet?"""
305526,0.0,2018,"the app kinda sucks to be honest, I'm  a big fan of kindle but this feels like I'm using a point of sale system from the 1980's"

305538,1.0,2018,worked perfect!
305539,0.0,2018,"I am sure the app works just fine, but... If you have an Amazon Business Account, for some reason you are not allowed to sign into this app.  Why in the world would that be a reason to forbid someone from using the Kindle Reader App for the PC?  I had to create a 2nd personal account to get it to work.  Maybe a 2 star rating is too low for this reason... Fine, I will make it 3 stars.  If it had worked on my business accou t and I was rating solely on it's merits, it would be a 4 star app."
305540,1.0,2018,Great app for reading Kindle books.
305541,1.0,2018,work like it suppose too so  you can read it on the pc
305542,-1.0,2018,It is useless unless you have a Kindle deveice.
305543,1.0,2018,Read only part of the book. Appears to be a good information source for importing products from China.
305544,1.0,2018,Nice app. I use it in my Kindle sharing books with my PC and mobile ... great innovation!!
305545,1.0,2018,"I recently had to use the Overdrive and Axis360 apps to read a couple of library books.  Both experiences were like driving an old AMC Gremlin after being used to driving a muscle car.  They were awkward to use, slow, crashed constantly, you name it.  Say what you will about Amazon and what they've done to local retail (and I have said much that is unpirntable on that topic), but the Kindle app does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it does it very, very well.  I hate that.  I mean, I love it, but I hate that I love it.

Now, if they would just please add the ability to drag and drop books into any order we want and fix that annoying little bug where the covers of returned library books can't be deleted from the ""all"" library even after deleting them from ""manage content and devices,"" it would be just about perfect."
305546,1.0,2018,I still use this app too.
305547,1.0,2018,"I read constantly, so I have my kindle everywhere."
305558,-1.0,2018,"I am very disappointed with this app. Many books show up as single page, the search capability is usually stuck at 'indexing'. There is a lack of ability to easily control reading options such as font size. (You can do it, however it's not as easy as it should be) The Nook app for Windows 10 is amazing compared to the Kindle app. I have gone back to using my Kindle reader instead of using this app."
305559,-1.0,2018,I'm trying to deliver my book to my PC. I have a Kindle E-reader app with books on this PC. Under devices however it shows no PC. The new Kindle for PC download remains blank.

305566,1.0,2018,"Works very well, thanks!"

305580,1.0,2018,I love to read on my computer makes it so big I can see the words.  Why I am not able to read any real paper bound books because of my sight this app lets me to be able too.  Great app.
305581,1.0,2018,"I bought this book after I found out that the series on Netflix Seyit & Sura was based on a true story. The Netflix series was very painful to watch - an emotional roller coaster full of deceit and intrigue. Reading the book helped calm those emotions after learning how they really lived their lives. I am impressed by the amount of research that went into this book, considering that this story occurred 0ver 100 years ago.

The book was easy to read. I am not a history buff and usually get bored when reading books on historical stuff but this book held my attention. In fact, I could not put it down. I would like to extend my gratitude to the author, Nermin Bezmen, for sharing her family's story with us. I also appreciate that she follows the Seyit & Sura facebook page so when we have questions about the story, she is very quick to share her thoughts and answer our questions."

305646,-1.0,2018,"This app is atrocious, and it is the reason that I buy my e-books from Barnes and Noble unless they are unavailable there and I *have* to have the book (like a text book).  The Barnes and Noble Nook app is light years better, as was the old Kindle Modern app that was available in the Windows Store but has since been mysteriously removed.

This app seems to be constructed solely with old mouse and keyboard use in mind, and this approach has two fatal flaws: 1) Pretty much every Windows laptop these days is designed to function as a tablet as well as a PC. And 2) Why in the world would anyone want to read an e-book *exclusively* on a desktop?  For my part, I have several Windows convertible devices, and I often use them to read e-books in tablet mode (frequently) as well as to write papers while referencing those e-books in desktop mode (much less frequently).  The Kindle app is servicable for the latter purpose, but absolutely unusable for the former purpose.

Until Amazon fixes this app, I will continue to purchase my ebooks through Barnes and Noble, unless I am forced to rent through Amazon for a course."

305661,1.0,2018,"Timelost is the story of Miko Almstrom, Lieutenant, NAVO Force Pilot...a human on a recon mission gone wrong getting waylaid in an alien ambush by Audra of the Zikri species. This species are very intelligent and very tough to kill and Audra being one of the oldest of her kind is very formidable and has formed an accidental bond via a bio pilot connection on Setty II, Miko's NAVO stealth ship. After months of forced coupling with the Zikri and evading both Zikri and Human NAVO forces they crash land on a primitive but hostile planet where Miko escapes Audra by slashing their bio conection violently. Audra is relentless in hunting him down to once again be joined with her chosen mate. This is basically a horrifying...one way love story as Miko would rather die than forced to bond again with Audra. Miko is trying to evade a vicious pack type creature hunting him when he stumbles into the remains of an alien ship that reveals itself to be a slaughterhouse torture chamber and as the pack creatures close in on Miko suddenly Audra is there dispatching them brutally while Miko escapes to a room where there is a glowing 3 sided apparatus in desperation. This turns out to be another alien races intergalactic transporter system and his body in ethereal form is being transported across space to an unknown place and time. The place turns out to be an immensely huge ship of the Locust or Mentera. The time however is several centuries into the future. Somehow the ancient hyper jump machines have affected Miko giving him the ability to phase in and out of his body when he is experiencing high stress life or death situations...unfortunately for him he can not control this phenomena.

The bad news keeps coming for Audra through her determination and bonding dependency on Miko follows him into the transporter and is hot on his trail. On board the immense Locust ship Miko releases a fellow human named Fenli who has been slowly having his life force sucked out of him literally in the Locust feeding tank for the last four years. They also accidentally release a Locust from a feeding tank and he ends up joining their fight for freedom... Miko names him Usk. Fenli turns out to be more than a bit of a con man and during their escape sees a very valuable item trapped in a tank which he convinces Miko to help him get aboard a ship they are commandeering from the Locust mother ship. The valuable cargo turns out to be the Empress of a humanoid race called the Jakru and she is a devastatingly beautiful woman called Lexia.

The story continues with more horrors, pitched battles, formation of companions from all over, wild escapes and fantastic brutal adventures on different planets, continually going from the frying pan into the fire on many occasions, To tell more would be a spoiler! This book carries on with their adventures and many difficult and brutal trials by fire. You will find this to be an amazing ride... so hop on and hang on.

You may be puzzled by some of the places and situations our band of galactic misfits find themselves in and out of. The best way to describe it as enjoying the journey that they all experience... the good, bad and the down right ugly!!!"
305662,1.0,2018,Needed this for my college course. Didn't have any problems accessing my textbook when I needed it. Has great highlighting and note taking features.
305663,1.0,2018,I like the most it allows me to read books at lesser prices. And download is free for PCs. I wonder if there is mobile version also free.

I only use it for reading and it is similar to the kindle I had. I found it much easier and it is portable.  I love my laptop for working at home, it was not feasible to take to bed."
305677,-1.0,2018,"No good.
Does not work on my Vista but it good on everything else."
305678,-1.0,2018,"This product sucks.  When I download it and attempt to put in the same user id and password I use to log in to Amazon, it taes me right back to the login screen.  It has done this on EVERY system I attempt to install it on."
305679,1.0,2018,"By carefully selecting the options available, the latest Kindle for Windows on even a small laptop produces a very pleasant reading experience, even if your vision is not the best at your comfortable hands to eyes reading distance. It sure beats reading from a book whose font size is too small for comfort."
305680,1.0,2018,"I love it. Makes it very easy to to have all my books at once.
And I like the fact that cost much less than a hard copy.
Other advantage it is the immediate resources at hand to look for places and words.

305684,1.0,2018,"This is a must. I have had this on every device I've owned for the past several years. It has always performed flawlessly. My favorite feature is if I read on my Android phone when I get back to the laptop it knows where my place is. Seems minor, but makes the experience of ebooks so much more enjoyable. Gee, I wish I could find something I don't like about this app, but I just can't come up with anything."

305745,1.0,2018,It's great being able to access all of my Kindle books via my PC. I have a few textbooks and reference books that I use pretty extensively. I can just set up these texts next to whatever I am working on. Very satisfied!
305746,1.0,2018,Like my flexibility for digital reading.  Thanks
305767,1.0,2018,Just like advertised!!
305768,0.0,2018,"Not bad as an app,  however it is missing a myriad of features that other free ebook apps have.

I was disappointed that books cannot be transferred easily over to a book reader that's not affiliated with Kindle."

305771,1.0,2018,"Above and beyond what one would or could  expect.
The ONLY possible improvement FOR ME, since I LOVE hi-lighting, is more hi-lighting colors :-) :-)"
305772,1.0,2018,I needed this for my kindle.  I am very pleased with it.
305773,1.0,2018,Kindle for PC (download) has been very rewarding for me in that I am able to get many books that I enjoy and read them in my home on my pc.  It saves me time from going downtown to the public library and renting/checking out electronic books to read.  I would recommend it to anyone.
305774,1.0,2018,"The book is excellent, but there is something wrong with the formatting. I can't view bookmarks."
305775,-1.0,2018,Can not get it to load up.
305776,1.0,2018,Very practical for avid readers across all genres. Wish there was a way to arrange the ebooks in the library

C'est un grand pas dans l'utilisation soucieuse du droit des auteurEs des oeuvres lues. Je deviens un fan  tout va du lecteur Kindle.
De plus le systme de notes est facile  utiliser et surtout stable et fiable. Vous revenez 3 mois aprs et vos notes sont toujours intactes. Un outil sans prix pour l'utilisateur que je suis!

305807,1.0,2018,I live this app.  The best ever
305808,1.0,2018,"I especially like the ability to download my Amazon reading material purchases and read them at my full-sized desktop PC.  It also give me the opportunity to refresh my memory regarding which books I've purchased.  This app is a winner from every possible point of view!  To whoever developed it, I give my undying gratitude!  Thank you all so much and especially thanks to Amazon for permitting it to be released at no charge so us older computer people can read it on our larger, higher resolution monitors!  "
305809,0.0,2018,Does not work well with MS Surface Pro in Tablet mode.  Text view is very narrow.  Can't access any controls in tablet mode.
305810,1.0,2018,Its great
305811,0.0,2018,The app works but it does not act like a an app more like a web page almost they took away some of my favorite features from the android version. It is hard to use at times wish they make more user friendly.
305812,1.0,2018,Easy to use on my laptop.
305813,1.0,2018,The reader must be familiar with the series to understand the letters.
305814,1.0,2018,"It works great on my surface.  The reason I gave it 4 stars was because I wished it allowed me to use the
surface pen to write (not type) notes directly on the ebook."
305815,1.0,2018,"I can't take too long writing this because I want to go back to reading my kindle book! Suffice it to say, that I love Kindle. I travel around the world and I cannot take all my books with me, but through Kindle I can!"
305816,1.0,2018,I liked that it is free and a fast download. I liked that it syncs with my other devices and I can pick up where I left off no matter where I read it from.
305827,1.0,2018,"when you make a  ""bulk download"" button? <--FIX THAT!!  & you'll get 5 stars..i am weird, i DO NOT TRUST the ""CLOUD"" it has been  proven time and again to be  insecure.  so putting my books there  just  pisses me off.

  i want  copies  downloaded to my laptop for my reading pleasure..other than that?

  making ""collections"" is a pain in the ass. FIX THIS!

  now..this is a nice app. it works as it should EXCEPTING for the 2 above issues.

  i like the darker  theme. i have vision problems so darker themes are  MOST welcome..you wanna  improve that?  make a black background with medium green text.  THAT is  the best for me!

 i like being able to read  my books on any of my devices at any time."
305828,1.0,2018,Exactly what I expected.
305829,1.0,2018,This product works very well on all of my computers. what I am reading on one picks up just where I left off on another.
305830,1.0,2018,I liked that it was available.  I liked the least that it was difficult to find on the website.
305831,1.0,2018,This app works on all of my tablets and computers. It is great
305832,0.0,2018,"I like Kindle Reader.  I find I can read books easier on my computer than with a physical book.  However, I notice on some books that the original page numbers are not given nor searchable.  In class, when the teacher says to go to a specific page, I am unable to follow."
305833,-1.0,2018,"I tried to do zero stars because a tech, not me, could not get it downloaded to my laptop.
When I called Amazon for help I have to say I was treated very rudely and forwarded to a person who tried to bully me and told me I had  compromised all my accounts and they could be being bleeded dry. I laid the phone down and as I  walked off I could still hear the person talking loudly. I shut the phone off and have not tried again.
I believe it was was a ruse but I changed my Amazon password anyway.
I, as you know, use Kindle frequently and recommend Kindle and books available on it. My other problems have been handled kindly.
Pat Cook"
305834,1.0,2018,Worked for me and it was free
305835,1.0,2018,I've always been a reader going through book after book.  Using Kindle is just another aid to enjoy literature.
305836,0.0,2018,"Although I love the ability to use the collections, it's just a bit tedious to use. I don't like that control screen too much to look at in the beginning (it would be better last like it used to be), but I do like the menu at the bottom.  It is too hard to access notes,  bookmarks and the like.  I like the app picture; it distinguishing from other apps."
305847,1.0,2018,Great for laptops without android.
305848,1.0,2018,"Love it.  I can read my books on my computer, or on my phone when I don't have my Kindle with me."
305849,1.0,2018,works great on my win 10 pc. I am able to read all my books here (with a much bigger screen).
305852,1.0,2018,the older app was easier
305853,-1.0,2018,"The fact that this a program for reading books and there is no way to change the size of the pages is unforgivable. I don't need the option to make flashcards or change the text size, I need the ability to zoom in on pages that are too small to read."
305855,1.0,2018,I have an iPad Pro and I have a Windows ultra-portable laptop/tablet (Windows 10). Kindle for PC gives me access to my Amazon library and is - just - simply - easy to use. Kindle is Kindle. It works well and I enjoy it almost everyday.
305856,1.0,2018,The one for Android and PC works great. The one for the I Phone does not let me download any books.
305867,1.0,2018,"I am a retired software/database developer and feel the software is flawed but not a disaster.
The primary flaw is that the app has a hardcoded path to where it looks for books which cannot be changed.
Inexcusable sloppy programming.
I expect to find more as I go.
I give it 4 stars simply because I have seen much worse programming and it does work well enough.
It is a simple work around to reorganize your book files as you would like then open the file system and click on the file name after setting Kindle as the default app.
In my case, Kindle installed as the default without prompting me. (Strike 2)
Do a Google search for other free reader apps as well as for ""Project Gutenberg"" to expand your options"
305868,-1.0,2018,I used my Kindle for scvhool and I cant read personal documents on this app.
305869,-1.0,2018,I am unable to access this application. It brings me to the Business account and not to my accumulated books. I am using Windows 10 if that is part of the problem.
305870,1.0,2018,I like that I can read sitting at my desk in full print
305871,1.0,2018,This works really well!
305872,1.0,2018,This is truly a heart-warming story of a ten year old boy who learns important life lessons.  I loved this book and would recommend it to everyone!
305873,1.0,2018,Love this app.
305874,-1.0,2018,This app is terrible compared to the iOS version. It's a shame that Amazon treats its customers so poorly by disabling useful features like being able to zoom on figures which are far to small. This is a noticeable problem with many kindle books as well regardless of the app. The resolution and quality of the figures can be completely unacceptable for a book that costs over $100 for the kindle version.
305875,1.0,2018,works great just like a kindle but easier.
305876,1.0,2018,"A valuable book.

I regret that it was not with me 20 years ago."
305897,1.0,2018,Is exactly what i wanted.
305898,1.0,2018,Something you just gotta have if you have an Amazon acct and want to read books.  It is a great app.  Highly Recommend!
305899,1.0,2018,"Simply, I like every Amazon.com product"
305900,-1.0,2018,Very annoying app. It is too focused on sales and I ended up using a different android app.
305901,1.0,2018,"I preferred the earlier version of ""Kindle for PC"", but mine became corrupted and I couldn't find it to download from any sites. So I gave in and got this. I prefer to read Kindle books on my Kindle, but sometimes you need the big screen on your PC, (graphic novels, heavily illustrated books, technical books, and so on). This worked fine to allow me to read books in my Kindle library on my PC. Actually, it's better integrated for switching between the app and the Amazon website than the old software was, so that's a plus. I still do most all of my managing on the Amazon website, but for the purpose of just big monitor reading this app was fine."
305902,1.0,2018,Use this app for all my ebook reading
305904,1.0,2018,"Can't beat the Kindle Reader for practicality. I don't have to lug along a book to read on the bus, which I used to do. Now I can just whip out my phone, which I have with me all the time, and read to my heart's content. I love my Kindle reader. Jean B. MacLeod."
305905,0.0,2018,Worked like it should
305906,1.0,2018,"I am very satisfied with all this app. Although the pages and characters are smaller on a smart phone than they are on a reader or a tablet, I have not found this to be a problem. When you open a book, the app asks you if you want to go the most recent page read on your Kindle, as applicable. It's great!"
305918,-1.0,2018,I have tried many many times to login and the same error notice comes up saying my password and user name are not right. However I can login to my amazon account easily with the same information. So something is not right with this app even though it was free. I downloaded it to my pc with Windows 10.  I have this same app on my phone and have purchased many books that work very well.
305919,1.0,2018,Works wonderful for the price
305920,0.0,2018,It is not what i was looking for. What i wanted was the Shortcut for my kindle that disappeared from my pc desktop and Start menu after I updated Windows 10 on my pc. Can you help me get it back? please? I am dying to get back to my reading and I had several books in my library waiting. Thanks.
305921,-1.0,2018,Zoom feature is not great on the PC.
305922,0.0,2018,"i Like the app I would just like to change the settings and view point of the list of books as well as the way the list is displayed, i would also like to see it more like the app on my tablet than the way it is."
305923,1.0,2018,This app from Amazon allows me to easily read all of our Kindle book purchases on my HP laptop computer. It was quick and easy to download and has worked well with no problems. We have over 900 books in the cloud in our library and can read them over and over on any of our devices.
305924,-1.0,2018,"Terrible for windows tablets. Does not recognize touch as a proper input as well as stylus does not work on the kindle. At this day and age, I would expect kindle to support note taking with stylus and to have the ability to properly recognize touch inputs. Only touch input recognized was scrolling back and forth between pages however there is no way to select a passage for highlighting. While even most basic pdf readers have this capability not having it on kindle is a huge disappointment. There is also no way to read the book in its original format. I do understand the benefits of using the kindle format (ability to change the fonts ...) however I would have preferred a scaled digital copy of the book rather than the weird kindle format. Its features might be sufficient if you are reading a novel but if you plan to read something academic it is the worst reader option out there."
305925,1.0,2018,"A Reader's Delight!

""The Hat"" by C. S. Boyack

This Novella has all the elements you want in a READ! There's a 21 year-old young lady, Lizzie St. Laurent, a college dropout who works two jobs to eke out her living, who deviously grabs a small box off a moving van on her Grandmother's Will-signing day, who will unwittingly begin a most delightful paranormal adventure... ""The Hat"" by C. S. Boyack is the story of a wacky, what else, 'hat' from another dimension that beguiles and frustrates Lizzie.

When Lizzie's best friend's baby is kidnapped by a ring of, well, 'baby snatchers', the 'hat' will become indispensible in its rescue. It's amazing what this 'hat' can do...he ('it') can transform Lizzie into a bizarre killing machine...'it' has hundreds of years equity in Lizzie's generational pool and shares some of that long, long ago history.

There is so much happening! Lizzie loses her jobs, but a way is figured out to live. There is music, too! My goodness! Could this be made into a 'Musical'?! ""The Hat"" does have that quality! This delightful short-fic will have you laughing out loud, hiding behind the sofa, and, it's a bet you will be reading this guy, C. S. Boyack, many more times...he's got to be a little wacky himself! (Just kidding, Mr. Boyack!)

You heard it here!

Oh, one final comment: there is also a unique 'end-of-Novella' author section where you will meet my girlfriend!!! :-)"
305926,1.0,2018,This makes carrying books so handy!  I need my portable computer with me anyway.  No heavy books!
305937,-1.0,2018,"Ive primarily used iPads with the Kindle app to read about 600 books. Im breaking in my new Surface, downloaded this app to start reading and a little shocked by how awful it is. The interface is non-intuitive and difficult. I still haven't quite figured it out and I guess Im  going to need to go through blogs, support and help to be able to use this app comfortably  if its possible.

Im also going to take a closer look at Nook and maybe others. Im a KU user as well as Prime but doesnt make any difference. I rather enjoy reading than being frustrated by this app. Ill stop both if there isn't a way to make this app user friendly.

Frankly, Im wondering if its advantageous for Amazon to make this app better on other platforms. I would never have expected such a bad reading experience from Amazon/Kindle."

306015,0.0,2018,"Very good for reading Kindle Apps.  Has the feel of the Kindle for IOS or the Kindle.  Supports Font Size, Page Color etc.  Unlike the IOS version, it supports ""Text to Speech"".  Biggest disappointment and the reason it only received 3 stars is, I cant get ""Immersion Reading"" to work.  In the IOS version, if you have both the Audible and Kindle versions of a book, then you can listen to the Audible book while following along in the Kindle book.  I am an older reader and often suffer from eye strain.  By following along in the Kindle version, it not only seems to allow me to absorb the material easier, but also allows me to stop and copy notes for future use."

306100,1.0,2018,"Paul N. Larsen has a talent for getting his point across in a lot of different ways. His message is straightforward: a leader needs to be aware at all times of how his or her values align with ultimate goals. His mnemonic VOICE (Values, Outcomes, Influence, Courage and Expression) is only one of many tools designed to help a busy paid or volunteer worker carve out time for the self-reflection and planning needed to turn ambition into accomplishment. FIND YOUR VOICE AS A LEADER is therefore far from a straight read. Larsen uses calendar-style formats, illustrative stories, familiar business-plan strategies and sharply-focused questions and affirmations to break his message into accessible and realistic steps for a reader who wants to enhance his or her abilities as a leader. Interacting with Larsens book offers clues to his coaching style and suggests some of the reasons for his own success. He turns a subject about which there is a great deal of talk into ideas that can be approached with actions, replacing say with do. A good starting point for someone who believes he or she can do more to be successful but needs to focus more clearly on specific strategies for change and action."
306101,1.0,2018,Love my kindle.
306102,1.0,2018,Great
306103,1.0,2018,"Thank you for not charging for this app. Love the way it is set up in chapters, pages read book marks, highlighting, and copying."
306104,1.0,2018,ok
306105,1.0,2018,"Taming the Tokolosh is another can't-put-down, emotionally victorious account of horror and ultimate freedom.  A first hand look at the brutality of the human condition, and it's redemption, the Author reveals her deepest weaknesses, describes the terrible journey it took her to find her strength - and shares techniques that worked in the most impossible of circumstances!  This is a book to share, share, and share again, so that others can benefit from Ms. Bass's experience."
306106,1.0,2018,"Articulates just how unglamorous working behind the scenes in the beauty industry actually is. Funny, authentic. Loved it!"
306117,-1.0,2018,Junk.
306118,1.0,2018,Works great - can't beat the price :-)
306119,-1.0,2018,Very basic book for anyone who knows nothing about crypto currencies. Nothing here that will help you configure a miner or set up a trading account. Very little technical information.
306120,-1.0,2018,"After text selection, if you click on the blank space of the page, it will go randomly to 1 page up or down, annoying af."
306121,1.0,2018,Great for reading on the go.
306122,1.0,2018,disreguard last review my eyes aren't what they used to be
306123,1.0,2018,Simply easy .quick and no problem finding this and downloading .Thanks to all at Amazon and Kindle .
306124,1.0,2018,"This book came to me at exactly the right time.  Im a woman, small business owner, medical professional, and I try To Do It All.  I realize that I need to admit that Im not only stressed, but Im completely burned out!  What a relief to know there are answers for helping me to change and heal.  I have been feeling so guilty about the changes I need to make in my business.  I was afraid of offending others and not doing it right.  After reading Achieve More by Saying Yes to Less, I realized that simple changes to my beliefs can make time management, business productivity, and stress management more achievable.  The S.A.S.S. program gives easy steps for changing my beliefs around how Im supposed to run my life.  And its setup in easily digestible chunks.  In the first 20 minutes of reading this book, I made my first change! I said my first I Love You Sandwich.  It wasn't pretty, but it was my start."
306125,-1.0,2018,This new app stinks. I want the old one back. Not as easy to read on my pc. Setup is terrible.
314722,1.0,2018,This free app works amazingly well to edit photos that can then be printed. Definitely worth the download!
314723,-1.0,2018,"Not enough, control, no insert text, no cropping...."
314726,1.0,2018,good to use till now
314727,-1.0,2018,"It was okay while I was able to use it.  But after 3 hours, it stopped working and it became clear that my ""free"" use was over.  I won't buy it.  From what I experienced, it does not resize nor does it let you crop to any size.  What a bummer!"
314728,1.0,2018,Great addition to my photo manipulation tools.
314936,-1.0,2018,Serial number doesnt work.
314937,1.0,2018,better than paying a monthly fee
314939,-1.0,2018,"I bought this because of difficulty encountered in trying to run an older version of Photoshop on my iMac.  This stand-alone (non-subscription) desktop version of Lightroom would be the way to go.  However, its interface is a bit too non-intuitive for me, so I called Adobe tech support to find out how to start editing a file.  I was a bit shocked to learn that it can't do straightforward things that you can do with Preview (which is included with Mac OS X); e.g., the tech support people were bewildered by the idea of my wanting to change the size of a JPEG image - can't do that!"
314941,-1.0,2018,Was NOT clear from posted specs that it is compatible with RAW files from only a very limited number of cameras. I now use On1 and find it far easier to use and much less expensive. I will never purchase another Adobe product.
314942,1.0,2018,As one of the best light rooms I've ever used still learning
314943,1.0,2018,This is my fourth purchase of Lightroom products and the second for Lightroom 6.  I love it.
314944,1.0,2018,"Quality photo editing program.  Probably the best for PCs.  Last of the adobe stand alone, single purchases.  Seems everyone is going to a monthly contract.  Great tutorials online to learn to use it."
314945,1.0,2018,good choice
314947,1.0,2018,There isn't much to say about Photoshop or Lightroom. Excellent photos say it for you.
314948,1.0,2018,"This is a great program for batch processing for photography. This is not a replacement for Photoshop, but it's handy and you can do some quick edits and make some cool adjustments. Overall, the best part is that it's nondestructive and is user friendly."
314949,1.0,2018,"It's a standard for a reason.  I refuse to do the subscription model from Adobe, so this is my last version of Lightroom.  Slower than version 5, but has a few more features, so it's a wash, I guess.  Integrates seamlessly with Photoshop 6.  I'd say the cataloging features are unparalleled at this point in 2018."
314950,-1.0,2018,I was so looking forward to this product to help me with photography. Highly recommended. But I cannot even download it due to a clitch with my Adobe password. Even changing my passwrd did not help. So here it sits and I am fuming.
314951,1.0,2018,"Very feature-laden software, with the concomitant complexity and steep learning curve."
314952,0.0,2018,"I purchased the Lightroom 6 PC/Mac Disc

I am currently running macOS High Sierra V 10.13, MBPro 15"" (late 2011) 2.4 gHz Core i7 16gb ram

Main reason I purchased/ upgraded/ not really happy about the upgrade, is that LR5 does not support Raw file from Canon 6D MkII. It would require converting CR2 to DNG just to import on to LR5. Which is time consuming and takes up a lot of HD space.

Pro -
Performance seems to be enhanced compared to LR5
Panorama
HDR

Cons -
Price $$$
No more updates after V 6.14
My computer does not support Graphics Processor Acceleration because AMD Radeon HD 6000M series is unsupported.
Dehaze tool bar not included but.....

There is a free work around that uses the presets into a dehaze tool. Just search for Prolost Dehaze.

Overall
Disappointed that Adobe stopped the support for standalone. And this purchase was not worth it. It's like purchasing an UPDATE and not an UPGRADE."
314953,-1.0,2018,"Recent purchase Adobe photoshop elements and Lightroom: do not buy these products; key items are NOT included in the software, Photoshop does not link properly with Lightroom, lightroom will not allow photoshop editor to open when selecting options for HDR or combining photos into layers; adobe support not easily available and not helpful when they do answer---whats more, Adobe will not grant any credit for previous purchase to upgrade to the web version."
314954,1.0,2018,I keep havinv to uninstall and re-install
314955,1.0,2018,"I was really happy to find LR6 with a CD installation on Amazon. The price was reasonable and I prefer to have the software in hand and not do a subscription over time. I am pleased with the editing and organization capabilities of LR6 but that's really because I have taken a course with a professional photographer on editing with LR. Prior to taking this course, I was not happy with LR when I did a trial because it lacked some of the more creative aspects/effects that PSE14 offered."
314956,-1.0,2018,"This product did not work with my raw photos from my Canon Mark IV.
If I would have known this prior I would not have purchased the product.
I spent a lot of money for software I can not use! Not happy with it!
Do you research before you buy!"
314958,1.0,2018,So happy with this purchase! Now its just a matter of learning the software! Theres so much to learn! But this software is exactly what I was looking for.
314959,1.0,2018,Thanks!
314960,1.0,2018,works well w/ my PC
314961,1.0,2018,Great software.
314962,1.0,2018,Great
314963,-1.0,2018,"I downloaded this product on a MacBook Pro, and the product will not open. I've reported the problem to Adobe with no response. I would not recommend this product for anyone with an Apple computer. It was a total waste of money."
314964,-1.0,2018,"I bought this for my raw Canon Mark IV photos. I have to get the CC if I want them to import directly. So now, I have to convert them to DNG. Another Adobe lame ass scam."
314965,1.0,2018,shipped fast was exactly as advertised
314966,-1.0,2018,"When Adobe can cheat you with their product (LR 6), the ruling is vice versa.
Get a pirated copy of Lightroom instead of paying $149.
That's the best way of paying Adobe back in their own way."
314967,-1.0,2018,"I love lightroom BUT... I bought this under the auspices of being NEW. When I got it, the box and DVD had been opened. Why do I pay for new when I got USED?"
314968,1.0,2018,Editing my photos was simple. The program was easy to follow using the educational instructions on YouTube
314969,1.0,2018,Very good

314972,1.0,2018,Great for my photos.
314973,-1.0,2018,"Lightroom is a wonderful program, but currently Adobe is switching everything to their cloud based (Creative Cloud, CC) services. This might cause catastrophic (loss of your catalog with all your saved edits) conflicts forcing you to install the CC version of Lightroom to get updates, and then losing LR 6 catalog since you in fact do not have a valid Lightroom CC prescription. Until those are sorted out (which might never happen since Adobe wants everybody to switch yo their prescription based services in Creative Cloud) I can not recommend this, however good the actual photo edition functionality is.

In all fairness, this problem is more related to Lightroom CC than Lightroom 6, but since it also affects Lightroom 6 it does affect this rating too. I recommend everybody to consider the other, non adobe alternatives for editing, RAW-editing etc."
314974,1.0,2018,I love this product!  Shipping was very fast!
314975,0.0,2018,"Was looking for a Photoshop product to create book covers.  Standard book size templates are not available.  The only book templates are for photojournalist ""Picture Books.""

Very disappointing."
314976,-1.0,2018,"Lightroom classicCC (the latest) is pure memory hogging, slow moving, garbage."
314977,-1.0,2018,Right now I don't like it. I can't enter the serial number because the numbers on the box are not long enough. I  bought a Canon 6D mark II  and couldn't get the RAW images on my old PhotoShop 7 . So I decided to get lightroom 6  program and now can't find the serial number long enough.  I bought it through B & H and they said I would have to go to the Abode site. I couldn't find out any thing. So I've spent $150 for software I don't know how to get onto my computer. Adobe is hard to get an answer from. Still waiting for an answer since Nov 2017.
314978,-1.0,2018,"I had high hopes for LR6 because I loved LR5 and was eager for more options in LR6, however, LR6 turned out to be a HUGE disappointment. LR6 constantly crashes. It is extremely frustrating to be in the middle of editing a pic and have the software completely crash and close. And this happens FREQUENTLY. I've yet to have one photo editing session that didn't result in at least one crash. I often wonder if Adobe added bugs intentionally to make users subscribe to their CC. I tried subscribing to the cloud but found that the stand alone software seemed to have more options and was more user friendly. Or maybe it was just because I was used to the overall look and operation of LR5 but I found that I preferred the standalone software over the monthly subscription based product. In my opinion, Adobe needs to step up their game and stop trying to take advantage of consumers!"
315386,1.0,2018,"Totally awesome!!! I am writing this review using Dragon NaturallySpeaking basics 13.0. I am running Windows 10 and it is working flawlessly. I saw many negative reviews and questioned whether I should buy it, but at only $20 I figured I didn't have much to lose. I'm delighted with it. I think that you need a very good microphone. I have a Koss cs-100, which is supposed to be the top rated microphone. I highly recommend this product."
315387,0.0,2018,"I had watched videos about Dragon Natually Speaking that said that it would transcribe audio files (.wav, mp3, etc) of a single person speaking. It was not clear to me that the BASIC version does not include this.
I have now purchased the PREMIUM version which does have the transcribing cabability. It works well for my spoken .wav files. Unfortunately, purchasing this BASIC version was a loss, as it did not do what I purchased it for.
Hope this review helps someone else choose which version they need."
315388,-1.0,2018,Doesn't work at all
315389,-1.0,2018,"As far as I can tell this product is completely useless. I purchased a headset designed for use with Dragon, but it did not help. Dragon NS runs painfully slowly and takes up 25-50 percent of the CPU on my reasonably fast laptop. The speech recognition lags way behind my speaking. It gets about one word in two correct for a sentence or two then hangs up thinking about what it is doing. Speech recognition for sloths I guess. The Dragon NS I used twenty years ago worked better and ran on a computer about 1/500th as powerful.

The software takes 90 seconds to start on my Windows machine. When it is done it is already using 450MB of core memory.

There is a training option on a set of very long passages, but the font is so terrible and the un-resizable window is so small that it is very difficult to read. Clearly these developers have no interest in the user interface. Their solution to having a decent font and window is ""would you like to print it so you can read it from paper?""

I bought the software to use with an application I am developing, but Dragon only types into a very few select applications. Otherwise everything gets buffered into a shim window and you have to use a mouse button to send it to your application.

A completely useless poor performer in all ways."
315390,-1.0,2018,It won't load with Windows 10.  Known problem.  Waste of my money :( NO REFUND
315391,0.0,2018,Does not pick up many words even after training
315392,1.0,2018,"Bought for a customer, works as intended."
315393,-1.0,2018,"I don't like this program, the customer service rep made me feel as if I was getting on her nerves while helping me download the product. Then they don't have any support on the weekends, and the microphone omg...not to mention it can't hear me or it don't understand me... And another thing Amazon can't help with the product you have to deal with the company itself."
315395,-1.0,2018,"I wish to discuss the reason why I returned Dragon Naturally Speaking Version 13. Specifically, the reason is due to an apparent compatibility issue this software has with Windows 10. So, upon not being able to successfully launch Dragon Naturally Speaking Version 13 on my laptop (which utilizes Windows 10 as its operating system) I researched this matter in an attempt to troubleshoot and therefore resolve the problem on my own and learned that this problem is apparently substantially widespread. The makers of  Dragon Naturally Speaking software and those organizations who distribute and sell this product to end-user consumers are not doing anyone involved at any point of the supply chain and distribution channels any good by: (1) failing to resolve the software glitch in this current version of the product; (2) knowingly distributing and selling a product that is at risk of failing to perform as advertising suggests to many potential consumers who now have Windows 10 as the operating system for which they are also buying this product; and (3) failing to at least attempt to warn consumers in advance of purchase that Dragon Naturally Speaking Version 13 is highly unlikely to work in the event that those persons intend on using this product on a computer that uses Windows 10 as its operating system. . Further, professionally, I am a marketing and business consultant. Accordingly, my job requires me to do a substantial amount of writing. But, I even have a more vested interest and a substantial need for this product because I had the great misfortune of paralyzing my right arm and hand several months ago. (Typing with only the use of my left hand really sucks, especially, since I was able to type at 75 WPM before paralyzing my write arm and hand). Consequently, (I was really looking forward to and almost certainly) I could have benefited from Dragon Naturally Speaking Version 13 as it is advertised. Finally, I have made several phone calls and sent several emails to Amazon and the manufacturer of Dragon Naturally Speaking Version 13. In the event you care to discuss this in further detail, you can reach me at my alternative email at: mark.starks7675@gmail.com.  As of the submission of this Customer Service Survey, no one from either organization has bothered to reply.  Check out the following discussion: Dragon NaturallySpeaking Does NOT work on Windows 10: https://www.computerhope.com/forum/index.php?topic=157495.0

Thank you for taking time to consider my comments regarding this issue.  Mark"
315396,1.0,2018,This works perfectly with Windows 10.
315508,-1.0,2018,"I bought this because I needed a version not Internet dependent.  It is the 2015  desktop version and it does not include any Help files.  If you click on Help it tries to go to the Adobe website.  And even worse, if you connect it to the internet and click on help, the link is broken.  This was a bug in the original Lightroom 6 (2015).  An update was later provided by Adobe, but it is not on this disk.  The original update is no longer available and after much browsing I finally found a way that Adobe would update.  The only problem is that when you get the update it also automatically installs a current version of Lightroom CC on your computer without telling you that it is doing that or even giving you a choice.  It does leave this 2015 version installed and workable, but of course the CC version does not work unless you pay Adobe.  You can uninstall the CC version with an uninstaller like Revo Pro, but when it gets to the cleanup stage you are confronted with a long list of registry entries and files that you have no clue as to whether they are specific to the CC version or if LR 6 also depends on them.  The only choice is to leave them on your PC.  More useless clutter.  Had I known any of this I would have purchased Capture One instead."
315509,1.0,2018,"Works great, just double-check your settings if the extraction menu fails to advance."
315510,1.0,2018,A necessary program for photographers big and small. Process through Amazon a breeze. Highly recommend.
315511,1.0,2018,The goodest!
315512,-1.0,2018,"Great product..WHEN IT WORKS.

I have downloaded and installed multiple times. It works until I shut down my cpu and tells me I need to reinstall the product. ADOBE still has no fix for this issue although many others have reported the issue all the way back to early 2017.

Very frustrating and not worth the money. Best to get this product through means that do not include wasting your money."
315513,-1.0,2018,"Windows 10 is installed on my computer - The installer was using Windows 7.  I can't seem to get the installer to,accept Windows 10.  Any suggestions?"

315517,-1.0,2018,"Nothing in the description said Lightroom 6 wouldn't support my Canon 200D SL2, thanks allot, I just wasted $149.00!"
315518,1.0,2018,"It took a while to get used to the interface and to realize how LR was storing and accessing my photos. Now that I've delved more into the editing capabilities, I'm very happy with my final image outputs and am really pleased with how well LR fixes both spots and various detractors, such as a piece of fishing line stuck on a wood duck's green head. That was amazing! One trace over the fishing line and it disappeared as if it had never been there! I'm certain I'll like the software even better once I've done more experimentation. One LR goes to subscription based, that will be the last I use it. As long as version 6 still functions, I'm good."
315519,-1.0,2018,"Was hoping to use this to organize the 12,000+ photos on my computer. It was slow and clunky in doing so. No substitute for manual organization."

315522,-1.0,2018,DO NOT GET THIS!!!!! I got this product a while back. A few months later it just stopped working. It would give various error messages as well. Another thing is that this is an older version. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing has worked. I ended up forgetting about this whole thing and getting the photoshop+lightroom through Adobe which now works. DO NOT GET THIS!!!

315819,1.0,2018,Awesome!!!
315820,1.0,2018,It does not have Repeat step sequencer obtion... and u are not able to use all plugins. U should buy and register them seperately:(( thats how they make money. No difference from demo instead of saving what have u done and  better quality of sound. If u are beginner instal demo version first and see how do u do )))
315821,1.0,2018,perfect gift for my son! Hes been asking for it since before Xmas and I finally gave in. Easy install that a 14yo could handle himself and could start playing with immediately.

316839,-1.0,2018,Beware of all the OEM versions of the software. Activate it more than one on your computer and Microsoft will block it.  I bought an OEM version on Amazon.

Microsoft rep said that all OEM products have a limited activation and to contact the OEM for a new product key.  This is for any version of Windows 10 OS.

316845,1.0,2018,"I recently started a brand new PC build and I really needed a Windows 10 program, be it flash or CD. I didn't want to go to some weird website that sold Windows 10 for something dirt cheap, I wanted a real copy for my very first build. After a few short hours of searching the internet for a (cheap) Windows 10 program, I finally found one that would give it to me Same-Day via Prime (full price but oh well!), which is excellent since I'm fairly impatient. The disc and envelope it came in were all legit, Microsoft brand.
There was an option to ""Conceal"" your package before purchasing this item in which I really was going to opt in for, but due to my excitement of getting it Same-Day, I placed the order before I could stop myself from clicking ""Place Order"".
I popped in the disc for my new PC to boot the official Windows 10. First Try, it worked.

The reviews that you see coming from 1-star or complaining about fake codes or anything like that are scammers. They are trying to get more codes out of Amazon or Microsoft so please don't listen/read into them.

316868,1.0,2018,Didn't buy mine here and glad I didn't after seeing so many reviews about pirated copies. I am not very impressed. I built myself a new computer with an 8th gen Intel CPU (300 Series) and a 300 series ASRock motherboard. This is necessary if you want to use a 4k monitor to watch movies on and double as a monitor. Everything has to be HDCP compliant. And I mean everything!!! (Not like Blu-Ray) After I built it I put Windows 8.1 Pro 64bit back on it. No issues except I kept getting an annoying pop-up from microsoft which reminded be at least twice a day that said my current CPU and Motherboard is better suited for Windows 10 because of the updates. So I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro 64bit. It does not work any better than Win 8.1 just more bells and whistles and they moved everything around to different locations. I am not very impressed with the updates. I like how the updates were received and accepted on 8.1 At least you had a choice. Also NOT impressed with using a PIN to log on after start-up. My desktop is in my bedroom. I should at least have the option of not using the PIN to log in.  I understand there is no work around. I looked.

316888,0.0,2018,"This rating applies to both my feelings on the product, and my experience buying/installing it.
Windows 10 is all right.  It's slicker and more user friendly than Linux, but not by much, and certainly not enough to justify the cost. Then why buy it? Because I'm a gamer and don't have the time and/or patience to make all my non-Linux games work on Linux, especially the MMOs that require additional monkeying with everytime they update, only to suffer some degree of performance loss from running the game in a non-native environment.
My experience in installing was also very mediocre... I used a USB optical drive to load the install software and was able to get to the part where it asked for my product key. Like many of the commenters below, the software didn't accept the key, and I began to feel like I got a bad product.  Since I had bought it from Amazon Services, I requested a replacement.  But while I waited for it to get delivered, I did a little research and I decided to create a USB bootable key and try that instead (Google: 'Window 10 media creation tool'). Booting the software from the USB key resulted in the program accepting the original key sent, and a full and satisfactory install of the software. Why the install software included on the disk didn't accept the key when the USB key version did? I have no ideal... but if you're having problems installing from the disk you might try this. One note: after the installer copies the files to the selected hard drive and does some installation it will tell you Windows needs to restart, and give you a 10-second countdown. REMOVE THE USB KEY at this time, or after the restart it will just boot into the install program again.
Now I just have to figure you how to return the unneeded, unused replacement version of the software without having to pay for the shipping on it..."

Recently it did an auto update that makes it impossible for me to connect to RDS(remote desktop) which allows me to connect to my work remotely, I work remotely so this is crucial.  If you reverse the update it will again update automatically.  I've been reluctant to switch to apple but since doing it with my phone am sure I can do it with my desktop."
316907,-1.0,2018,"Computer users have to be aware of the essential design of Windows, cell phones, tablets. Basically, the thought processes needed to work these devices can be  dumbed down to the most basic behavioral  science experiment: the rat being placed in a maze and finding the lever to press to get the cheese reward. Anytime you operate a computer or cell phone, you are basically pressing a button to get a reward. A picture, a program, a song, a blank page to type a letter, even the letter itself is the most basic ""press the button for the reward""-a letter to appear on your screen. There is no intelligence beyond some short term or intermediate term memory function in this process. No problem solving ability. No critical thinking or decision making- just which button to press to get your reward, or alternatively, which turn in the maze to get you to your reward?

Alas, this  ""computing"" is for 99% of the users and no wonder the population is getting dumber. Microsoft and Apple expand the choices, and the menus, not based on any logical thought process or design, but a by firehosing an orgy of redundant, contradictory, confusing, competing  and useless distractions on your screen,  mostly disguised as advertisements to trick you into switching, subscribing, or ""saving"" by buying some useless program. ( I hate the word ""app"". You aren't cool if you don't use the word ""app"". How can you be cool if ya ain't got the ""apps""?  How can have your pudding if you don't have your ""apps."")

So in short, all these companies are doing is expanding the maze that you, the rat, have to navigate. You aren't getting any smarter just because you expend the time to learn the maze, you are just demonstrating that you have wasted more time than others who are tech ""dummies"" to learn the maze. The programmers themselves can no longer  write a concise, logical program , especially electronic medical records or electronic hospital records to be specific.

I used to be able to populate the icons I need on my desktop, and now I find I have stumbled into some useless rotating billboard of solitaire, songs, videogames and other complete wastes of time. I can't even restore the icons or even the background pictures like I had since I was using windows 95 to 2007.

But Microsoft, Apple et al get to sell you something over and over again."

It seems to be updating more often than I am able to use it, constantly has issues, even with fresh installs, and is overall so terrible if all of my games weren't bought for PC instead of Mac I'd switch. I have had several updates that take entirely too long to do, and I'm not talking hours, I'm talking literally days. I started an update five days ago, FIVE ENTIRE DAYS and it was still going when I woke up my PC today. the help/support can rarely tell me anything I don't already know, and the fact that in order to turn off automatic updates I have to wait and listen to their support person for a literal hour to get it done is ridiculous. I used to love Microsoft and windows, but now the only thing I like is word, and you have to pay by the month for the new versions which, while great for earning them money, is terrible for the customer. You used to be able to buy it for about $100, flat, one time fee, now you have to pay them per month with easily cost more than that in a year. Their updates take way too long, even if you do keep up with them. Five days for a single update, mind you I had updated my computer about a month ago, is obscene. I'm certain I'll think of more issues with Microsoft and Windows 10 specifically later. I miss Windows 7, I never had these issues with that version. I don't understand why Microsoft seems hellbent on breaking something that was decent. I understand ""upgrades"" but to me EVERYTHING about windows ten feels like a downgrade."

So I scratch and sniff open the Product Key while using a USB loaded with the MS download of Win 10 as my initial install.

""INVALID ACTIVATION CODE"".  Dang, really?

OK, so I will try this with the version on the CD inside the envelope. Literally two hours to copy off the CD and onto my thumb drive. I run that install version.

""INVALID ACTIVATION CODE"".  Again?

Go back and read some reviews of people getting used keys. I am not happy.

Then while gathering all the pieces to send back I notice this is really really secure packaging. I had to tear open a sealed envelope to get to the disk. The Product Key was under a scratch off covering. No one could have seen that,

So meanwhile I had installed Windows without the key (they let you do that?  Wow!) Surf out how to enter the activation key again, try that...

I have reading glasses on, and am being very careful to inspect each and every letter. I clean off the scratch off fluff again, and a letter that previously looked like a ""P"" now sure nuff looked like an ""F"" So I tried the ""F"".

I will not be home until Friday night and must restart the rendering process when i return home. I was hoping to use my computer for others things but now it will be tied up this whole weekend for rendering my project that is due this upcoming Monday. I have found you can disable the automatic updates through a series of workarounds and will be doing that ASAP as to avoid this type of extreme frustration again.

There were only 3 display resolution choices, no 4 digit resolution, only 3 digit sizing which are way too small and very poor.
So I did a factory reset which bricked my new computer, Thanks to Amazon and Amazon's wonderful sellers for refunding me promptly.

If you have Win7 beware: Many who love (loved) Windows 7 are furious that Windows 10 forced ""upgrade"" stole their Win7 when they boot the next morning. Microsoft is aggressively forcing people onto Win10, even giving it away. But it's an awful OS even if you're okay with your computer being used as a spy too for their profit.

316981,1.0,2018,"Windows 10 has become a stable product my only problem is that automatic updates aren't straight forward to turn off for professionals that deal with presentations, cash registers, etc. It's extremely annoying when windows starts updating after a restart."
316982,-1.0,2018,"Do not buy this, it is useless. It would not install and made me download the current version anyway, burn to USB Thumb drive and install from the thumb drive. THEN... the code had already been used and i had to spend 3-4 hours on the phone with a Windows technician who unlocked a new code for me who informed me they thought this software was pirated? You might as well download from windows and pay them the $89 for a new license."
316983,-1.0,2018,I hate Windows 10
316984,1.0,2018,This is the best version of Windows ever. I love the new features - too many to mention. I have been using Microsoft OS since early DOS.
316986,1.0,2018,"This installed easy and was legit; having been worried about all the fake versions.

This is real, comes packaged that way and installs easily. It's the real deal.

Again, you can it install it on one motherboard setup, unless you change the motherboard, call Microsoft directly and ask them to reset."
316987,1.0,2018,Install was clean and easy on a blank hard drive.  Key code worked fine.
316988,1.0,2018,great to be able to update my pc
316989,-1.0,2018,Its pirated don't buy it.
316990,1.0,2018,Worked as intended. Looking at these reviews i was praying i didn't get one where the activation key was already used but i had no issues.
316991,1.0,2018,I liked the easy-to-use installation. There was nothing that I complain about.
316992,1.0,2018,windows 10 what can I say
316993,-1.0,2018,I detest this operating system.  It is absolutely terrible
316994,1.0,2018,"Works great as expected.  If your thinking about trying to 'save money' and buy something cheaper on another site like ebay(like I did) then you probably should not do that.  The product I bought on ebay said 'new', 'never used'.....and it had not been opened but the code had been used so although I could install it I could not activate it because Microsoft said ""code has already been used"".  So, save your money and buy Windows OEM software an Amazon."

316996,-1.0,2018,"BUYER BEWARE!  Did not install, key code was invalid.  We had to hire someone to help us figure this out.  Amazon did not fully stand behind the product/buyer either, only issued us a partial credit."
316997,-1.0,2018,"If therebwas a way to give negative stars, that's what I would rate this transaction. Finally able to use the product, turns out the product activation key has been already used. Very disappointed in this as I have paid to get everything updated on my computer to find out that I now have to figure out how to activate Windows to for my computer to function. BUYER BEWARE!"
317000,1.0,2018,It works.
317001,1.0,2018,"I took a chance on buying this given the inconsistent reviews regarding the Product Code.  My HP laptop had some major issues that I think was related to some type of Malware, although none of the Malware/Anit-Virus programs could identify the issue.  I decided I needed to start all over and reload Windows.  The problem I had is my laptop came with Windows 7 and I upgraded to Windows 10.  I also did not have a copy of the restore media that came with my Computer and my Recovery Drive was corrupted.  This software arrived in one day, I loaded the DVD and it NEVER even asked me for the Product Code.  My guess is it may have recognized my Computer already had Windows 10, so maybe the Product Code was not required.  I loaded the DVD and had it erase everything, reload Windows 10, then download all the critical and current Windows 10 updates and now I am back up and running smooth and efficiently.  This completely fixed MY problem so for that reason I am very happy!  Luckily I had all my DOCS, Pics, and Videos Backed Up to an External Seagate Drive that allowed me to simply transfer them back to the Laptop after the install."
317002,-1.0,2018,"When I installed this and tried to activate it, I received a message that Microsoft couldn't activate it because this key was already installed on another computer. I believe it is a pirated copy and useless. I haven't heard back from seller regarding the problem."
317003,1.0,2018,returned because we ordered the wrong one
317004,1.0,2018,"Put it in, it updated my old computer running windows vista, still working as of 2/28/18 without any problems(freezing,stopping etc.)."
317005,-1.0,2018,Was givin a very old version of windows 10. Tried several reinstalls to get it functioning with out freezing. Finally with Microsofts help we got it updated and running well.

317013,1.0,2018,"Wtf I new that I was going to buy this an this would happen. It says that windows in not activated cause the key was used already. I better get my money back...

Update Amazon sent me a new one an it's worked. I didn't notice till now but the first one they sent me the key one it was already srached off. An the new one wasent."
317014,1.0,2018,Just what I needed.
317015,-1.0,2018,"didn't work on my old old computer, can't send it back because I open it,, over one hundred dollars down the drain"
317016,1.0,2018,OK
317017,1.0,2018,Worked as advertised for me...For all the people that thought it was pirated...It seemed pretty legit to me. the disc came in a sealed Microsoft package with scratch off key and desktop sticker. Someone probably just stole those peoples keys somehow. If that happens you can call Microsoft and they should be able to solve the issue over the phone.

I wanted a clean windows 10 install on the replacement drive since the failed drive started out in Windows 8, then 8.1, then down-graded to 7, then to 10. Windows 10 Builders OEM installed perfectly on the first attempt. I could not find a product key on the disc or packaging so I just selected 'I don't have one' and it installed anyway. Zero issues. This disc also included Windows 10 Pro. I don't need all the admin controls built into Pro so I just installed Home."
317021,-1.0,2018,id key was already in use and had to jump through microsoft hoops to get windows activated DO NOT BUY FROM Beta Software!!!!

Mine worked just fine and I haven't had any issues since I built my PC in June."
317026,-1.0,2018,"Caveat emptor.  I bought this for a new PC build.  When I tried to activate, I got the ""product key not valid"" message that many other purchasers also received.  On closer inspection of the packaging, I noticed a sticker marked ""new product"" that was covering most of another sticker.  When I peeled the top sticker off, the one underneath indicated it was used on a previous build in May, 2017.  Basically I was sold a ""used"" copy!

I feel this is very dishonest on the part of the seller.  My copy was basically useless because it could not be activated.  Fortunately I was still within the return period.  Take my advice: pay the extra to Microsoft to get a legitimate copy."
317027,0.0,2018,I paid the price . it worked. faster than down loading it.

317030,-1.0,2018,"Junk. Spam filled, spyware, data collecting, no features for you junk. This company is no longer serving the end-user."
317031,0.0,2018,"Having the start menu back and a better looking UI are the only benefits over Win8.1. Overall, Win10 has been nothing but a buggy steaming pile of excrement for me. My PC runs noticeably slower and this is even after disabling all of the spyware and other nonsense, like firewall entries for Candy Crush Saga.
It takes longer for the login screen to stop bugging out so I can type than it does to actually boot the OS.
Microsoft is obviously more concerned with developing and hiding new spyware in their OS than ensuring the OS actually provides a good experience to users. I'm glad I didn't pay for this.

Like the other reviews, I purchased Win10 from this seller & upon loading and installing the software today, Microsoft messaging indicates that the software cannot be activated because the product key is already in use on another device. Not an error on my part reading the key. This is fake software. Not genuine Microsoft or OEM product. DO NOT BUY. I am going to Microsoft website to purchase and download a genuine copy now. Stay away from this seller."
317037,1.0,2018,"again, I have this operating system and cannot use it since I was not able to repair the laptop I purchased this for, but I am satisfied with the item and will probably use it to upgrade some of the other laptops I have in my possession."

317425,-1.0,2018,"Microsoft will not register this copy of Windows keeps saying invalid key.  Spent 1.5 hours on the phone with Microsoft Tech Support trying to get it to register, finally gave up and purchased a new key."

317427,1.0,2018,Works great. Sticks when shutting down at times or during hibernation.
317428,0.0,2018,"Just got this product a few days ago and just got done upgrading.

1. Why? I have a Dell XPS 8700 running Windows 7 Pro - basically mirrored my office set up. At the office, we've gone to Windows 10 pro so I made the upgrade.
2. How easy was it? Well.... here is what happened. I bought the item and it appeared in my digital orders folder. I follow the instructions.
3. I had upgraded PC before so I had done all of the usual stuff: (1) made plenty of room for the new OS on the C drive (needs about 20 GB for the 64 bit version), (2) cleaned up the computer of temp files, junk and stuff, (3) made a backup and restore point, (4) located all of the old programs for a reinstall in case the upgrade didn't work, so I thought I was ready.
4. It takes a LONG time to down load the actual system, the download program that does the work is a quick file  - so don't be impatient - it is longer than some movies run and your time may depend on the speed of your connection, and time of day, etc.
5. Next there are two options - do you want to upgrade the computer you just downloaded the download program to or do you want to create a USB drive and upgrade off of this? (this is the case you were downloading on computer and upgrading another one).
6. Key point, the USB must be at least 8 GB and should be empty. It will have the iso file with the upgrade BUT you can't just copy to it, you have to use the program because it makes it a bootable USB drive.
7. THEN ... you can finally start upgrading...normally it takes a few hours I'm told, but this process took almost 10 hours. To their credit the support people at Microsoft were helpful. The program hung up because it claimed the product key was invalid.
8. After reaching the company and going over with them, they acknowledged the key was valid, and set to work - there is some glitch in the uploader program - we spent hours back and ultimately we got it to upgrade but then....
9. The video drivers won't load... because of a known problem with Nvidia and Windows 10, so back to stripping out all of the old stuff, literally seeking out individual files with names like nvdsp.inf, nv_lh, and nvoclock....and clean out all Nvidia Corporation folders and kill all processes using Task Manager...
10. Finally then do another install but choose the custom setting and pick the ones you need ...
And it worked ...and I'm writing this now.

So, was it worth it? I'm honestly not sure, but the program seems pretty stable so far. Since Windows 7 things have been OK - It looks like they are trying to create one common system for tablets, laptops and PCs.

Anyway - if you need for work - it is OK - but if you are not a real computer buff, and don't need to upgrade, you might want to wait and see if they can sort out these upgrade issues.

I went on line and it seems that there are some out there."
317429,1.0,2018,Received promptly. Just as expected. Would recommend.
317430,1.0,2018,"About 2 minutes after I bought this product my version of Windows 10  Pro was activated. All I had to do was highlight the product key, copy and then paste in the Windows Activation box and press enter.

The Heading ""Microsoft 10 Pro | Download"" is misleading. Amazon will only give you a product key and gives a hyperlink to a help page that tells you how to download the Windows 10 creation tool.

It appears Amazon will keep a copy of the product key in your software and digital download section of your account. To keep up to date with the Products Title, they should have done a hyperlink leading to the MediaCreationTool1803.exe right under the product key to stop the misleading word Download."
317432,1.0,2018,"Microsoft finally has earned 5 stars from me.  I have been installing Windows since 1991.  Actually, my Commodore 64 had Bill's Microsoft Disk Operating System way back in 1985. 10 is finally fully mature.  It refreshes itself just like phone operating systems by leaving all your ""stuff"" untouched while it updates or fully re-installs itself.  Windows 10 has had issues in the past, no doubt, but this iteration seems to have gotten it right."
317433,-1.0,2018,"I am a 30+ year *nix user, I use MicroSlug because my business requires it, so I carry a local copy.  I reloaded my desktop at home with *nix wanted to buy a legal copy of of Windows 10 Pro. paid 184.00 for this at best shopping around AND trying to get a legal copy I could reload if necessary (bear in mind the are a lot of disreputable sellers), I found this (yep there were 'cheaper' probably misrepresented MicroSlug products), I want ed to buy a genuine.  Thought as big as Amazon was and supposedly MicroSlug is, couldn't go wrong, Windows 10 Pro, wanted a genuine load.  So I load it on virtualbox, seems it is good, got to acting flakely so I said it is genuine, I can reload...Come to find out this product key is a rip off both from Amazon and MicroSoft.  I cannot reload it, even though I only have one computer and one copy which I only want/need to use out of necessity, not choice. I was ripped off.  This a reflection on both Amazon and MicroSoft... do it - to the best of your ability to do it right and be within the law and reasonable use and get burned.  I don't know yet haven't made up my mind, I may just smoke my Amazon account over this, 184.00 to do the right thing, and get burned... here let me help Microsoft and Amazon building a reputiontation togetgether, your are BOTH complicit and dishonest"
317434,-1.0,2018,"Updates may disable your startup. Fixes for known bugs often worse than the bugs. The current creators update package created so many errors i had to reinstall completely. I will post back with an update to tell you all if reinstalling fixed my problem ""BAD SYSTEM CONFIG INFO"" upon startup after the update mentioned before.

Had enough, if this install is not flawless, i will convert to linux for good and run windows vms from my college days if i need microsoft again. I will take steps to avoid their buggy, expensive, monopolization of my time and money if i run into ONE MORE FAILED BOOT ON MY BUSINESS COMPUTER....

UPDATE: The issue was with a part of the 'Creators Update' having to do with some SSD (Solid State Drive) software or configuration. I spent 16 hours searching for a solution, only to spend another 16 reinstalling my software, only to have Microsoft Update install the buggy update AGAIN and hose my installation... ....you guessed it, AGAIN.

What's interesting is that while Microsoft posted a release saying they were working on a fix for SOME brands, mine (M.2 NVMe Samsung EVO 250gb) was not listed among them, but suffered the same fate. I have done computer IT support and troubleshooting for fifteen years and I can tell you, Microsoft's drivers and hardware support software misses the mark time and again. If you cannot get a proper driver from your manufacturer's website, your PC will get it from Microsoft's Russian roulette.

As I promised, I will be switching all my software to Linux from here on out."

I Installed this software on a brand new computer with no other software on the drive or any other part of the computer.  Software installed with no issues ...  however, everything after that was a nightmare.  Programs that did install were hinky at best.  Some programs wouldn't install at all.  My previous computer had Windows 10 on it so it wasn't that the programs weren't compatible with W10.  After hours on the phone with microsoft remote tech support (and a week of complete frustration), they discovered that the Windows Management Instrumentation Services was corrupted along with other issues.  They could not fix those issues and said I needed to contact the provider of the software.  I finally got another new hard drive with a windows 10 already installed and voila - everything works like a charm - no hiccups, no hesitation with all the same programs.

I bought this on 1/18/18 for a new box because mine had crashed. I have litterally spent the last month plus trying to configure it for my work and life. Wow. What a hassle. Everything is blocked and you have to dig deep, WAY DEEP, and spend hours on the net to find ways to force win10 to let you configure it your way. I've been working on pcs, inside and out, including software for more than thirty years and I've never had setup issues like with this version of windows. Four restores in one month to fix what updates broke is ridiculous. Seriously, Windows, stop trying to be Apple. If I wanted what they offer I would have been with them all along.

Watch out for app/program compatibility too. Took me a month to finally get the accounting software I use for my business to work properly. It was chocking due to win10 deep configuration. After digging way down in the admin tools I was able to turn off windows and get a good install. Took a month. That's ridiculous. If I had it to do over I would load any version but this one. If it crashes again I'm going back to 7 Pro. Win 8 was awful, so now we have two bad iterations again. How is it that Windows can't consitently deliver good versions. Remember WinMe. That was just like Win8 and now Win 10 is just like Win XP. Win 7 was the best and most stable so I guess we're waiting for the next iteration for stability because win 10 breaks itself or something else with each update. Nightmare on wheels!"

Don't get me wrong, I have used old computers from the 90's and they have never failed out on me, whatsoever. And a few were Windows 95 based. I also have an old computer from the mid-to-late 90's and it still has lasted for years without any hard drive failure whatsoever and still works very very strong. I have used a Dell Studio XPS, until the motherboard burned up about 6 to 12 months after upgrading from Vista to Windows 7. Heck, it was at least 9 years old before the hard drive, motherboard and the power supply burned out, and it was from 2008 or 2009. Some people have tried to install USB devices on the computer and some never even worked. I have remembered one of my friends that have an MS-DOS PC from 1991 and it still worked perfectly. Old software even seemed to run a lot stronger than the newest software or hardware they have out today. Strange days.

I would not buy new computers because of the fact that there are bugs with the hardware that is installed on it. And rather stay with a 486 computer because it would last a very long time."

However, it seems they've resolved everything because I haven't run into any issues with it yet. This OS, alongside my new ssd, make using my PC flawless fast again. Worth the upgrade."

I use Linux full-time, but I need to install Windows on a second machine for teaching. So I paid for Windows 10 here, but Microsoft threw up a bizarre error code, directed me to the automated help agent which asked me to choose the error code from a pop-up menu (of course, the pop-up menu did not contain the error code that I got) and then pretty much didn't know what to do after that. Eventually it seemed to be telling me to change the user agent string in my browser...???

At that point, I had had enough, so I called Amazon for a refund.

I'm still leaving 3 stars because I'm quite sure this will work for many other people. But clearly the download is not supported on certain systems."

I mean, the control panel is the most disjointed piece of crap I've ever seen. I just cannot believe that anyone could have thought it was a good idea to actually put this product out on the market. Windows 7 was just so much better, and, while I can understand the desire to incorporate apps and try to make computers feel more like cell phones and tablets, maybe they should have taken coherent steps toward that end instead of jumping headlong into this mess."
317638,-1.0,2018,"This is the only review I have ever left on something, ever. Long story short, the code I received was not valid. I wasted $100 on something that didn't even work.

317640,-1.0,2018,"After several attempts to load this software on our ASUS laptop computer, I went to the ""Geek Squad"" at Best Buy and they could not load it either.  They got farther than I did in the process, but they reached the part in the load process where you put in the product key and the product key is incorrect and will not allow loading--the product key was printed directly from the Amazon download software library, it was notv possible for me to use wrong digits.  So the product was defective.  I took the laptop to an independent computer repair service and the software itself is not necessary.  If you have Windows 8 there is an embedded script that allows you to download Windows 10, so I wasted over $100--it was a worthless purchase and Amazon will not exchange according to their policy."

317648,-1.0,2018,"Ads appear in the start menu. Updates can't be delayed for longer than a few hours before the OS will install the updates and reboot the machine. Privacy settings and ad settings get reverted when microsoft pushes an update. Contains a lot of bloat software. Pressing the ""windows"" key and typing the name of the program/file you wish to open usually doesn't pull up the program/file you want , but instead will just show you advertisements. All these features help make Microsoft more money on a product they already charge their customers for. If at all possible, go with Ubuntu instead of Windows, even if you are considering transitioning from Windows 7 to 10, it will be an easier learning curve to learn Ubuntu than to have to relearn the new GUI for windows 10.

317664,1.0,2018,"Very complicated to install. This is an official Microsoft product, but it gave me error codes so many times that I was having my doubts. There is a microsoft ""helper"" tool that automatically launches once it recognizes that your PC has an older version of windows and the problem is that this ""helper"" doesn't seem compatible with older versions of windows. It was crashing non-stop and after a little research I found that the media creation tool was the culprit. I had to change come source code on the Microsoft page so that I could directly download the program without the ""helper"" tool activating. If you don't know how to do this you may want to consider one of the site that sells the software on a flash drive.

Once I bypassed the Microsoft tool and completed my download, the new OS is working great. It's a shame they make the download process so needlessly complicated."

317667,1.0,2018,no issues. Works just fine.
317670,-1.0,2018,Wow what a hot pile of garbage.  To think I have to pay hundreds just for software that apple gives to their users for free.
317671,-1.0,2018,"Windows 10, like many of the most recent Windows releases, starts out slick. Seems fast, works out, easy enough to learn the interface (which, by the way, is completely unlike previous Windows releases, so strap in to have no idea where everything is). However, like all recent Windows releases, it gets worse with each update. They install software you don't want. Update popups show up that make you drop out of games or lock you out of your work apps. You can't disable the Microsoft popups. You can't uninstall apps that you don't want to use. They have what is essentially a keylogger in the form of Cortana running in the background, so when you open an app, you mysteriously lose keystrokes as the data collection software tries to catch up. Long story short, Microsoft continues to try to put themselves out of business by releasing garbage software. If I want big brother software that forces me to deal with apps I don't want, data collection I don't want, and popups I don't want, I'd buy an Apple. Now, why did I give them 1 star if the system does mostly work? Because they make it impossible to get support, so you can't ask questions like ""how do I get rid of the pop up that just crashed my gaming match?""."
317672,-1.0,2018,"This OS has bugs on it! You won't be able to access the web through MSEdge. You'll get the Error Code: INET_E_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND, that will prevent you from accessing the internet. The updates have done nothing to solve this, and all attempts to fix this problem have failed

Also, won't let me sign into my windows account. It just guess off as if I never clicked ""sign-in"".

Microsoft no longer cares about it's products. They'll release buggy OS's, and it's been over a year and they still haven't fixed these bugs. They are actively scamming customers by rolling out such a faulty O.S.!"

317675,1.0,2018,"Keeps things current I guess (i.e. trying to keep ahead of designed in obsolescence), but the install over 8.1 left a number of irritations to resolve.

FYI, after giving OneDrive a try, I found that if you allow the OneDrive Network setting of ""Don't Limit"", even my little Lenovo Yoga 2 pro ultrabook format laptop can completely swamp the entire internet service for itself and the other computers in the house.  Speedtest would show extremely slow internet on all the computers, not just the laptop.  I would try rebooting and for a moment speed was back to normal, but then it would drop again.  I am talking many hundreds of ms for pings, 0.2 Mbps up, barely 1-2Mbps down ...

Anyway, after a few days of trying to blame the ISP for flaky inconsistent service (after all, that laptop was only on part of the time - so part of the time speed was great), and them showing me that it actually was not a problem between the ISP and the Wifi access point, I thought back through all the changes that had been made recently, and finally took a closer look at OneDrive.  That is when I noticed the OneDrive Network settings options of ""don't limit"" and tried a different choice (limit to 125Kbps).  Since then everything is just peachy.

There should be some sort of HAZARDOUS MATERIAL warning on that OneDrive setitng."
317676,-1.0,2018,"Windows 10 is a great way to get your children off of the computer and looking for anything else to do! Though, it may get them in trouble with the authorities. Because, after experiencing Windows 10, doing meth probably sounds okay.
Actually, this is probably a good measurement of a child's future:
If the kid enjoys Windows 10 - You won't have to worry about saving for college!
If the kid hates Windows 10 - There's a higher probability of the child having a bright future.

The installation was easy, it probably took less than an hour to install and completely update (as far as I wanted to tell).
Although, twenty minutes was spent disabling all of their BS features. It should be called: Windows Social.
So, one hour to install, update, and initial settings adjustments...well, attempting to figure out how to adjust things that worked in Windows 7 and don't for Windows 10. When I was using Bing to search...lol jay kay, Bing sucks. When I was attempting to search for answers, there were none.
Even microsofts page, Users with the exact same issue, no answer. No answer on any thread, for any site. I can only imagine the Users became discouraged by their thorough questions receiving answers that didn't even pertain to the subject.

It feels basic, as if its meant for people that are either too stupid to use a PC. Or, they have more important things to do, to them, and don't want to take the time, due to what minimal processes they need.
And, I'm not opposed to positive progress and change. I love it, esp. with technology. But, when I'm upgrading something that I've already developed a series of patterns and quick movements to navigate easier, and those features are no longer there, or, replaced with absurd features...
Who needs the taskbar on all monitors? That's like putting multiple light switches in a narrow hall way because you're lazy. Quit being a weak gened loser and put in that minimal effort.
Windows 10 is for people that choose to not bother with their blinker in their vehicle. You know, the one that's right next to your left hand? Assuming you have both hands...Either way, I drive manual. I've had an over-sized soft drink in one hand and STILL used my blinker with my shifting hand.

Just think about it as upgrading from Windows XP to Win7, and how XP had the quick launch section, while in Win7 you had to do a few steps to add that section to the taskbar. Windows 10 is like that, except, I'm still trying to find the answers for some of this stuff.
It's basically an operating system that wants you to integrate with EVERYTHING. You don't have to...as far as I can tell with the minimal effort I put in to disabling those options. But, it wants you to.
Your tablet, your social life, there's even a Beta 'Eye Control' feature. Next thing you know Windows will come with that robot from the original NES and you'll be hamboning just to turn on your PC.

Another example: While in settings, the scroll function just stopped. The scroll bar was moving. But, the text was static and wouldn't display the lower information. It still seems rather buggy. I feel like I just paid to beta test their OS.

I love computers. I've grown up with computers. Microsoft has ruined my desire to ever use a computer, again. 'again'

My only regret, other than spending money on this, installing it, wasting my time, ruining my PC experience, annoying my friends and neighbors with endless profanity, the knowledge that they're probably going to make the next OS even worse, that I can't escape M$ because most companies use them...
It's that I didn't order a physical copy, so that I can take out my aggression and place it into the deepest, darkest fissure I can find.
Or, just find the nearest outhouse and place it where it belongs.

If this product is the bee's knees for you, I'm happy. You are the target market. I'm sure its suitable for your needs.
 - You just want to browse the internet, check email, pay bills, use minimal applications (Office, Media Player, Ski Free)
You know what, I take it back. You're worth more than this. You deserve better. Allowing yourself to be complacent with Windows 10 is a crime against yourself. Besides, you probably have a cell phone that already does the above and is easier for you.

If you use this product and think, I may have just ruined the rest of my week. Well, pull a chair up to the circle and tell tell us your story.

I will state: I feel like my PC runs better on Windows 10 - a smoother experience with my hardware.
But, all of the inconveniences make it worse and I really can't tell through my rage filled eyes :)"

Do not buy this product. Do not try to install this product. In 20 years, nothing has changed -- Microsoft still has no idea how to make products that work.

317698,-1.0,2018,"This operation system is by far the most unstable OS I have ever used, and frankly it has no business even being in release at this point.

I am (was) using this OS on 3 higher end Asus and MSI laptops. The two MSI laptops are the exact same, and came installed with 10. The Asus is a few years old and upgraded to 10 from 8 (Boy what a mistake). Usually, about once a day performing various tasks, a various driver stops working completely and requires a restart. Often, restarting the computer freezes up and it cannot even restart. When ever I experience a problem, it appears that several other users based on online commentary also are experiencing the problem.

Fortunately, Microsoft manages to correct these problems with updates every few months. The down side is that when ever one update is installed, and one problem is fixed, another one is created with the update. I had decided I had enough and put a hard drive in the Asus computer with windows 8.1 on it, and the Asus runs smoothly again. The MSI harddrive is not so easy to swap, so I wound up partitioning it and running Linux on the system. While the Windows 10 OS continues to crash and burn and quit drivers, the Linux OS seems to run smoothly with no problems ever as of this review.

Overall, this operating system will likely be the last I get from Microsoft, I can't afford to deal with the nonsense."

317709,1.0,2018,"I won't delve into the topic of whether Windows 10 is good or bad. That horse has already been gracefully beaten to death online.

WINDOWS 10 HOME VS PRO:
This product is Widows 10 home. There is another version - Windows 10 pro that includes additional features such as domain join, Group policy management, bitlocker, remote desktop etc. If you are using Windows 10 for casual use then you can use the Windows 10 home. You can install same applications, software and the end user experience is same on both version of Windows.

WHAT IS DOWNLOAD VERSION
There are other version available which have the Windows packaged on either CD/DVD or USB drive. The license/product key for the Windows is on the box containing the media. However, this version provides you with the license/product key and expects you to download the windows from Microsoft's website.

HOW TO INSTALL THIS VERSION
After you buy the Windows 10 you would receive an email containing the license/product key. Product key is a combination of 25 digits and characters. The email contains link to a page on instruction to redeem the purchased item. The page specifies the link on Microsoft's web-site where you can download Windows. Form that site you can download Windows Media creation Tool or Widows ISO. The media creation tool lets you create a bootable USB of Windows for installation. Whatever way you choose, the installation media will have files for installing both Home and Pro version.

You might experience one problem if you are upgrading from a Pro version of older Windows (e.g. Windows  pro or Windows 8 pro) to this Home version. After the upgrade you would find that you have Windows 10 Pro installed and the purchased license key would not work. So if you are upgrading from a Pro version you would have to perform a clean install to get Windows 10 home version. This would mean that you have to backup all data because the clean install will delete all the data on the installation drive.

When performing a clean install, you insert the media (DVD or USB drive) which contains the Windows 10 and reboot the device. Since we want the computer to boot from this media, so make sure that in the BIOS the boot-order specifies computer will try to boot from the media before the Hard disk. You would have to consult your computer's/laptop's manual to see how to set that. Usually when you boot the computer the very first screen shows the key to press to enter BiOS configuration (e.g. in my case I had to press F2 to enter BiOS configuration) As part of the installation process the computer will reboot. At this point make sure to remove the DVD/USB otherwise the installation process will begin again.

Things are really straight forward if you are upgrading from a previous Windows Home version. You can simply insert the media and click on executable file name ""setup.exe"". This will start the installation process.

HOW TO USE THE PRODUCT KEY

The product key received with this purchase would be of 25 characters (combination of numbers and alphabets.) Soon after starting the installation, Windows 10 would show a screen asking for the  product activation key. The received product key needs to  be entered there. Windows will try to validate the key at this point. If it is not able to validate the key (in case Internet connection is not yet configured or not available), even then Windows will proceed and will get installed but will not be activated.

When Windows 10 installation process asks for product key, you can also select the option ""I don't have a product key"". In this case also, Windows 10 will get installed as deactivated.

If Windows 10 is deactivated then there are couple of features disabled (such as personalization features e.g. changing wallpaper, accent color) Also there will be watermark on the desktop saying that Windows 10 is not yet activated.

You can still activate the Windows 10 by entering the product key in Settings > Update and Security > Activation screen.

IS THIS COPY OF WINDOWS GENUINE
Seems like so. Other than the fact that it worked for me without any issues, Microsoft's website also sells the download version for the same price. However, with Amazon I can use the points and get points for the purchases, so it was a little cheaper by buying using Amazon's credit card. There are numerous other web-sites that sell the digital key for the Windows 10 for anywhere $15-$40. From different experiences posted online, it seems that getting those keys to work is simply a game of luck. Some of these keys are coming from people who are selling their key for cheap (because they got it for cheap from various discounts.) Some are straight-away scams. At-least this in one is genuine and I can get support if things don't work."
317710,-1.0,2018,This thing is a GD Scam. You spend over a hundred bucks to go to the microsoft website and there's no features on this. TOTAL GARBAGE.

317712,0.0,2018,"This is a real copy of Windows 10 with it's very own product key. You can use it to upgrade or as a clean install. In the interest of transparency I have to tell  you that I am not a fan of Windows forced replacement of Operating  systems.  I would still have XP if Could.

PROS:
  Full version, not the free starter.
  If you have a new system with the newer Intel or AMD processor or a newer better main-board you are going to get more out of them with Win 10. Many of the features that make these wicked fast are built to work with Win 10 and vice versa.
  This upgrade assimilated my old and flawed copy of Win 7 pro 64 without missing a beat. It took an hour.  Everything was there and worked. It scanned the system and downloaded and installed all the drivers for my Win 7 programs. Have no fear.
  It was not difficult to figure out how to work with it. Things are similar enough once I found that the settings symbol got me the control panel.

CONS:
  Microsoft does not provide nearly enough server bandwidth to download the file with Windows 10 in it. It took me from 9:00 pm Monday to 11:00 Tuesday to download it. That is normal. Sheer arrogant disregard for the captive consumer.
  You can also create a USB or DVD disc to ust to make a clean install on different PS, as in a new build.
  You need to be very observant when loading Win 10 because it had a huge amount of extra stuff that will be installed if you do not opt out.
  You are going to get Cortana weather you choose it or not. Many invasive programs are installed and are on by default. Sharing your information to all apps, the use of the microphone by apps and cortana,location, preference, delivery of ads to you are just a few.
  You may need to spend a day removing severe clutter in the menus caused by all of the games, apps and other things so that you can find the items you want. You will also spend a day making your personal data secure and stooping it from constantly popping things up on the screen. It will reverse some of those changes though.

ALL things being equal I like the new technology provided that allows me to get the most out of my new. wicked fact components but I hate all of the invasive apps and the sharing of all of my information by default to all apps. These should be opt in things. The clutter on the start menu is annoying too. This is Elvis in Vegas."

After writing the above review, I found that download instructions varied between my laptop with Win8.1 and my desktop with Win10. The desktop (Win10) instructions took me right to the software download button, whereas the upgrading path from 8.1 was confusing, at one point directing me to go to my Win8.1 Control Panel and locate the ""Enter and upgrade key,"" then enter my new Windows 25 digit product key. When I did that the  the new upgrade key failed. Frustrated, I searched Google for insight, but this led me to lots of outdated info. Finally, I wised up and read the download tool instructions more carefully. Using the download tool confused me at first, but ultimately it did work well. All-in-all, I am pleased with the final outcome, but I still feel that the process path needs work.  Why is a Win10 download for my desktop a no-brainer, and a struggle when I tried to upgrade my Win8.1 laptop?  JEH"
317737,-1.0,2018,"Each version of Windows has fewer features than the previous, and I'm not sure why I thought this one would be different, but the lack of a remote-desktop server in Windows 10 home is a cheap shot at trying to force upgrades to the Pro version.

317740,1.0,2018,"Part1, installation
After struggling for 3 days, finally installed! feel little weird that I should say sth positive about this version. This is a full version! No double. Even when I called Microsoft ask for support. NO verification needed like where I purchase it or when I purchase it. Microsoft directly gave me guilds.
My initial intention is to upgrade my windows 7 to this windows10. MS didn't do good job in giving informative tips of what ppl will encounter during installation/upgrade. But instruction clearly stated by moving to windows10, u will have3 options. 1 upgrade---ideally u don't need to do backup with this option. 2. clear installation, suggested to do backup before install, but your old documents will still be moved to new place, just the programs are gone. 3. Old school click .exe that you downloaded.
I tried the 1 and 2. Since 1 doesnt work,  stay on the page of getting update for two days I gave up. And try 2nd way, and it works. all things, including reinstall pdf, office, etc, should be done in 3 hours. Although the 2nd option require me tried several times, when to chose where to reboot my computer. ONE TIP, once installed, to avoid letting your computer enter the same installation page, ud better remove the USB immediately."

The problem was that when it didn't work, Amazon's representative told me in the most diplomatic way that it wasn't their problem and I should ask Microsoft for help instead. The representative then asked if I needed assistance with anything else I told them no and ended the chat.  I spent the next 2 hours with an amazing Microsoft rep who helped me out and fixed the problem. After that I received an email from the Amazon Rep about something must have gone wrong with the chat box, nonsense mixed with copy and pasted Amazon filler about striving to be the best customer service.  Save yourself the time and buy this through Microsoft themselves, they will actually help and solve any problems with the product."

My computer continues to warn me that my computer is unsafe due to this inability to update, but I beg to differ.  I believe my computer is unsafe because when I purchased it, it came preloaded with awful security preferences such as ""automatically store samples of my handwriting"" and other completely unnerving options.  My computer is unsafe because you insist upon monitoring all of my activities and sharing that information amongst yourselves, with other evil corporations, and most likely, the United States government.

I turn on the PC and do the initial prep and before moving on to the desktop I am met with a laundry list of options regarding information sharing/gathering from various sources to turn off. I am not just using this for some entertainment and I was feeling unsafe, so I of course uncheck all of it and it goes to the next update process which took HOURS on my hi-speed wired to the back of the tower internet service. I had to leave and came back later to it turned off and then I start it back up again only to find that it is doing more automatic updating that took another half an hour or so before I was able to get in and actually start setting everything up. My processor is a modern multicore processor at 3.0+ Ghz with 8 gigs of ram and it stalled doing everything to an extent, it looked nice and that was all the good I could say. Extremely clunky and random freezes were common even involving just the keyboard not even working right while everything else seemed ok. Something I have never in life seen happen as an issue in an OS before. The recourse usage on the HD would also frequently spike to nearly 100% for no reason as nothing could be happening at all and the reading on the system monitor are constantly all over the place anyways in other areas. So then I start poking around and go into Skype only to notice that instead of being asked to create an account THEY CREATED AN ACCOUNT FOR ME WITHOUT MY PERMISSION, I didn't sign up for skype anything before and now it's ready to go under my name right upon opening the program with nothing for me to choose beforehand, good thing I checked or I would never have known there was some secret account on me that they made. That's just wrong! And I thought needing a microsoft account just to access my own PC was over stepping the line. I think as recent as Windows 7's early days they would call something that does things like this malware/spyware. Doesn't help that the actual vulnerability of it to your every day malware is bad enough as it is. Not good at all, strongly recommend avoiding Windows 10 and being careful if your just using it for entertainment. Not a real OS."

Every program we use for our business requires Remote Desktop assistance from the software manufacturers to install now. After roughly 3 months of running smooth on a brand new computer it decided to corrupt the registry And no longer start up. Windows repair and restore points literally don't work.

All I have is a skeletal version on Windows 10 on my PC.  I can't to updates, can get into some of the program features either.  There are some downloads I can not do because of this.

318281,-1.0,2018,"Pros
-support personnel get back rather fast for bugs
-When it works it runs smooth

Cons-
-Buggy
-Theirs always an update
-updates are always unstable
It works but if you like gaming its really the only OS that is supported by developers so your stuck with windows. Would much more prefer to be running on a Mac OS. I've had windows for many years and almost every update they send out is always flawed and the odds of getting a fairly annoying bug is easy to happen. I had to buy this USB of Windows 10 because the previous version of windows 10 broke and even though my computer was connected to the internet via a Ethernet cable windows was telling me I wasn't connected. When I made contact with a Microsoft support personnel and going back and forth I was basically told that their last update in December of 2017 the released was very flawed and they don't know why. So i had to reset to a previous version of windows 10 but since windows wasn't connected to the internet and I no longer have a disk drive on my computer I was unfortunately forced to buy this."
318282,-1.0,2018,i bought this sept. of 2017 and have never been able to activate it. they say the key has been used and all they keep telling me is buy a new key. bill gates should have enough money and shouldn't steal $109.00 from me but that is what he is doing. i had a stroke and about to have another one with the way microsoft is treating me. some people might have $109.00 to throw away but i don't. thank for nothing amazon!

318284,1.0,2018,I sent for a refund since the box was empty ( No usb inside ) as soon as I threw the box away I heard something rattle... turns out the usb somehow got lodged in the borders of the box I had to disintegrate the package to get to it. Seller was very good in the way he recieved the complaint and for the device itself it does what its supposed to do no need for mounting or drivers or anything very plug and play friendly to get a fresh os installed on an old or new build.

I put it on an old laptop just to see if it was going to work. Had problems from the very start, trying to install on my other computers.
I finally got it installed an updated just to find out that the code send with this product was not from Microsoft, but a pasted on over the original code.
Everything about this USB drive does not match what Microsoft says need to be, like hologram on the drive.
I did not install this because in the beginning it would install on my desktop. I just thought I would wait till I bought  new parts to built another.
Now it on my computer but most of the stuff will not work, like the keyboard, when searching in the box.
It would be nice if you would sent me the right key for this program.
Or I have no choice but to let Microsoft and Amazon know that I was sold a copy of windows, and not the original product."
318338,-1.0,2018,"Do not buy this item. When it arrived the product key I received did not work. After a two hour phone call with Microsoft who also refused to help since I mad the mistake of buying this through amazon.

Luckily Amazon is nice enough to allow me to return it.

For the record it installed windows 10 just fine the key I received is not a correct one though. So I'd highly recommend not going through this seller."
318339,0.0,2018,"Yes it worked, eventually. The thumb drive they sent was useless. I ended up having to make my own using my own thumb drive. I just needed the key which was on a business card in the box. That could have been emailed. The whole reason I went with this was that It is the full retail version so It is transferable.

I had to fight for several hours before giving up and downloading a free ISO copy from Microsofts website. After that I used the provided code and it worked fine. Sad that the I closed thumb drive is a flimsy cheap little thing."
318340,-1.0,2018,"I had trouble figuring out how to pull the little blue cap off and ended up breaking the whole thing.  Why did they have to make it so difficult?  But, once it was in three pieces I just plugged the broken part with chip into my laptop and it worked."

Microsoft ended up having to give me a new key, and I had to remove the Bootcamp partition from Parallels.  Microsoft blames Parallels, and vice versa.  I have found Windows 10 to have the following annoyances:  Its default settings make privacy an issue.  Windows 10 updates overnight, but does not seem to recognize when the computer is still processing data, so hours of data processing time occasionally have been lost."
318362,1.0,2018,"After reading some bad reviews i feared i would face similar problems. When i purchased i chose a seller with 99% rating and i was not dissapointed. The product was delivered as expected, relatively fast delivery considering that i reside overseas, tracking was updated regularely bu amazon and installation was a walk, very easy. Being a microsoft product, the packaging seemed cheap, no holograms, for a while i thought i got a fake product, probably MS cut down costs to come up with a decent price. Having used windows 8 pro during the last four years(even xp was better) i am sure i will be happy with 10. My account just got activated and the updates were installed, and yes it is the UK version but having used italian version previously(the pc i had was not available in english when ordered) i will have a better experience with the english whose words are shorter and more comprehensive. Five stars for the product and amazon service!"

318375,-1.0,2018,I Thought this would allow me to rebuild my computer using the flash drive.  I ended up having to re-intstall win8.1 to win10 using an upgrade link and THEN using the key from win10 pro to get going!
318376,-1.0,2018,DO NOT BUY keys from this company. I bought a USB with Windows 10 on it. I was getting errors on it that said my key wasn't activated. I talked to Microsoft and they told me it was used on 2 devices already and that's why it couldn't be activated.
318377,-1.0,2018,i purchased this product twice and its was missing the usb the first time the secone time it over heated and couldn't even be found by computer management meaning it was defective all together
318378,1.0,2018,This was a purchase to upgrade from my old Windows 7 rig.  WOW!  This is the bomb!  One month into running this OS with little to no effort in updating drivers and keeping system running smoothly.  This is the windows OS you need!  Good thing here is that it's USB and I had this thing installed in about 4 minutes :)

318382,-1.0,2018,PRODUCT KEY DIDN'T WORK
318383,-1.0,2018,"Thumb drive felt cheap and was DOA.  Would not install.  Kept hitting an error when the installer tried to copy over tcpip.sys.  Luckily I work for a software company with an MSDN license and I was able to get a Windows 10 ISO downloaded from MSDN and burned to disc.  The disc installed via an external USB dvd drive so it wasn't a computer problem. The product key worked, though it wasn't obvious at first glance the insert was the product key.  Usually it is somewhere on the box, or printed on the manual.  Not an insert in the box.  Would be nice if they just labeled it product key instead of trying to be artsy and clever.

Overall, not a happy camper.  Also, make sure you do a custom setup when you install it as a lot of options are enabled by default to send usage and location data to MS (and potentially 3rd parties) for marketing purposes.  You have to opt out of it.  I was surprised by how much of that stuff is turned on by default.  I guess the concept of privacy isn't a thing anymore."
318384,-1.0,2018,"This is the second time I have tried, both said that they were already used. Does not work. Brand new build. I guess I will send back the rest of the computer to Amazon.

I'm deeply disappointed in the purchase and have since returned it (1/4/18), I will purchase in store or directly from Microsoft next time."

I could not find a customer service online, but the 'tech support' they offer only seems to be available via email.  I sent 5 customer service emails to the support team regarding this issue, each time requesting a call appointment (which they first said they would arrange), but each time I emailed them for appointment times to arrange, they would deflect with telling me to check something else.  I replied each time with I already tried that and please set up a call and each time they failed to help or schedule. There is no number for them and they refused to call me. I'm just frustrated at this point of weeks of trying and I can't get this to work, so returning."
319677,-1.0,2018,"The USB device seems to be pretty good, but the ""VHS2DVD Wizard"" software leaves a lot to be desired and is very ""buggy"".  On one of my computers, the preview screen was very small and was truncated on one side so that I could not see the entire picture that was being displayed by the video tape player.  I contacted support for the product and they promptly replied that I should lower my screen resolution and possibly move the application window to the far left of my screen.  Changing the resolution had no effect but moving the window to the left did cause the entire video to be displayed although still very small.  Both the ""editor"" and the ""dvd burner"" parts of the software and constantly hanging up when certain things are done. The software also cutoff the first 15 to 20 minutes of my capture  for no apparent reason.  Was able to use the USB device with other capture software that I have in order to transfer my VHS tapes to DVD.  Would really not recommend this product to anyone."
319678,1.0,2018,"Works well, but the instructions could be better."
319679,1.0,2018,worked pretty well but audio was difficult to get working
319680,1.0,2018,Does what it says. I have a Windows 10 64b & worked fine. Worth the money to get old tapes changed to DVD
319681,1.0,2018,"What a terrific way to convert and share memories with today's technology.  I am able to eliminate all those bulky VHS tapes (and I have A LOT) and burn those memories onto just a few thin DVDs.  I had never looked into this ability before and was surprised by how many choices there are.  There are more expensive versions, but I opted for this product.  It arrived within 2 days as promised and contained EVERYTHING I needed (except the VCR, of course).  Easy plug & play installation.  I was set up within minutes.

Everything was perfect except I could not record any audio.  After spending an evening trying everything, including a fresh install, I sent an email to the company.  Within 1 hour, the owner contacted me back to assist with tech support.  Crazy right?  The owner!  Keith was very patient and helpful and was able to assist me with my issue.  Talk about customer service!  So yeah, I selected the right product at the right price.

And by the way, you can also convert ANY old VHS movie you bought years ago (although it probably is considered piracy and so, you didn't hear it from me.)  The software basically turns into a TV and so, whatever you play on the VCR, the software records and you own it.

So, if the technology involved in converting your VHS tapes intimates you, this is the product to purchase.  You have full support only moments away!"
319682,-1.0,2018,Terrible product. Software would not download on my laptop. I tried for an hour and got nothing
319683,1.0,2018,"Easy to use ,good product."
319684,1.0,2018,Worked perfectly on Windows 10.  Copying a VHS is as easy as pushing play on the VCR and record in the software that comes included.  Trimming the new digital video is very simple once you figure it out.  Follow the step-by-step instructions that are included in the box.  They show you the proper settings to get things started.
319685,1.0,2018,"I have converted about 20 VHS videos so far with very little trouble. I have more VHS and others yet to go! It has stopped occasionally but a simple restart fixes it. It is not a video editor although it has some capability to crop, but for simply getting video from tape to digital, it's super simple. I thought about just sending all the tapes to a service for transfer to digital, but I can get more value out of doing it this way, and I can see what I have. Some of the tapes only have a little bit of video, some I don't care about, so I now know what I have and how to put it together.  I'll use a different video editing software for that, but the library I now have of all the old stuff is awesome.  Using Windows10."
319687,-1.0,2018,Did not work and did not have listed software
319688,1.0,2018,Worked perfectly to transfer old vhs home videos to digital video on my computer and no problem with the editing.

One should have a faster CPU to produce excellent results. Only part of the program will work for me. I will use it again, when I get a faster computer. On the whole, I am extremely pleased. (old home movies on VHS!)"
319694,-1.0,2018,I was very disappointed with this product. The software downloaded with no problem but the recording quality was horrible. There was no sound in the playback except for the background noise it picked up like what was playing on the TV that wasn't even hooked up to the VCR that the home movie was playing through.
319695,-1.0,2018,"I purchased this in the hopes of converting all my parents and grandparents video cassettes into DVDs but when I tried to record a home movie from my when my brother was born an error saying that the media ""was protected"" popped up and caused the whole program to freeze.

I spent hours trying to record properly after setting it up and it just doesn't work.  The best I got was about 2 minutes of very poor quality mpeg after recording a 2 hour VHS tape.  The product acted as though it was digitizing the tape in it's entirety but in reality only a tiny sub-section. was saved to disk.  My PC is fairly new, high powered and running the latest home version of Windows 10.  I rip DVD's and Blu-Rays all the time and have never had a problem.  Don't buy this."

320873,-1.0,2018,"Nothing wrong with Microsoft Office, however, the product received is for Eurozone, not US.  I tried the code provided in the package, plus 2 others provided by the seller.

I scheduled a return through Amazon, and as I was packing the product for return, I noticed the label says ""Eurozone"".  I want other US purchasers to be aware that this may be an issue from this seller."
320874,-1.0,2018,"If I could give this negative stars I would.

I bought the software and tried to install on a machine.  Microsoft says I have to have a Microsoft account in order to use.  So I setup the account.  I download and install Office.  Since this is a new computer it comes with Office 365 Bloatware already installed.  I didn't know this won't install over the Office 365 Bloatware.

So I had to uninstall Office 365, which screws up the Office 2016 install.  So I go to reinstall Office 2016 and it tells me that the key has already been used and that I have to use the Microsoft account I setup.  That password doesn't work.

I KNOW what password I used to setup that account because I use a password logger.

I try to get MS to reset that account but they tell me they don't have enough info to reset.

Beware when you buy this, you may be forced to buy again.  Make sure you setup an MS account before you try to install and know that the MS Account works before you start the install."
320875,1.0,2018,Solved my problem since my old version would not work on my PC.
320876,-1.0,2018,"I ordered this download with the impression from all of the information that it is a PC based version of Office 2016. Turns out it is Office 365, NOT Office Home & Business 2016.  No where does it say anything about Office 365 until you launch the software.  This appears to be a scam on Amazon's site."

320886,0.0,2018,MS Office Home and Business 2016. Product described as a CD.  This is the activation key only!
320887,1.0,2018,Easy to install and a necessity
320888,-1.0,2018,"BE CAREFUL WHEN BUYING THIS ITEM!!!. I bought to use along with a new computer, but it turns out that you NEED an online MICROSOFT ACCOUNT, which is fine. But when I tried to activate it, it said that ""the product is not available on your region, please contact support"". Also it turns out that I can't request a refund from Amazon, which is understandable as it is a software piece.

Tried to get support from Microsoft, but chat and call is not available during weekends. Read KB articles and I really think that I just have to assume this as lost money. Many people have had this issue, haven't found a single on that got a fix using Microsoft support. In an article it even said that probably the KEY is fake and that I should request a refund, I don't think this is the case.

Been using OFFICE for the past 20+ years but I guess now its time to switch to G SUITE + CHROME. Bye bye OFFICE, time to evolve I guess."

It continues to say the key code provided cannot be activated with the account, nor can i figure out how to activate it. I would appreciate it this mess can get sorted out as soon as possible please."
320891,1.0,2018,"works great.  easy enough to install.  and if need be, just get help from microsoft by clicking 'contact us' if you get an error.  they were easy to work with."

320899,1.0,2018,Use it everyday
320900,1.0,2018,Works as advertised.
320901,1.0,2018,"Amazon has a better price than MS, but the download is from MS.  Process very simple.  Amazon saves your info for future if you need.  Highly recommend getting the software from Amazon.  The MS Office suite is the classic.  I haven't starting using this version yet, but been using Office for over 20 years.  They are simply tools that work great.  I need some of the power tools in Excel and Office 365 doesn't seem to have them. Also, this is far cheaper in the longrun."
320902,1.0,2018,"arrived when it was estimated to, loaded on computer as was indicated!  Now the fun part importing all data to new laptop, not so fun.
note:  product key was readable and was accepted without any delays ( previous review stated otherwise, but wasn't a concern--has a bar code that may be able to be read if print isn't clear)"
320903,1.0,2018,Very easy to install. No issues to date. Very happy with purchase.
320904,1.0,2018,I really needed this update as the program I had was several years old. Great updated version.

320910,-1.0,2018,"Install did not work.  In my case, the computer continues to reach for an expired version of Office 365.  Now what?  Product is not returnable or refundable?????"
320911,0.0,2018,"Don't like the fact that I have to have a Microsoft Account to be able to install office. Also, the default is 32Bit and the installer doesn't tell you.

320926,1.0,2018,"I've used Microsoft Office for years and 2016 works as expected.  Word, Excel and Power point work just like they always have,however Outlook 2016 doesn't work well at all.  It is just awful.  It throws all of the mail in your inbox into the trash at the end of the day and then it apparently deletes email that has been in the trash for a week or so.  It is hard to believe that Microsoft considers Outlook 2016 an upgrade."
320927,1.0,2018,"This version has all the features and benefits I need.  I do not like the fact that after copying or cutting a cell in Excel, the program keeps that area highlighted assuming the user wants to copy or cut from there again.  Have to escape out of it. The rest is great."
320929,1.0,2018,"This has what I wanted, the office products, basically word and outlook are what I use, but didn't want to spend as much as they were separately. This is a nice package. I haven't had any issues yet. 2016 Outlook is nice. I would buy this again simply for the price. It's all expensive I think, but this was a good value."
320930,1.0,2018,This is great software-we use in all our computers.
320931,1.0,2018,Perfect for me
320932,1.0,2018,"challenging to install, if at first the codes don't work, try, try, try again

320937,1.0,2018,"I had purchased a new custom built computer with a ""clone"" of Microsoft Word.  I hated it and knew I had to get the latest version of Microsoft Word, the software I had been using since 2003.

320939,1.0,2018,"If you are familiar with older versions after Office 2000 then at first glance you will think not much has changed, but there have been improvements in some areas.  If you have a licensed working copy of office already on your box I wouldn't bother upgrading, but if you buy a new PC and need it then it works fine.  I did  not experience any of the installation issues that others claimed to have.  If you did have a problem the key gets added to your MS account so it is easy to download another copy to your machine."

320943,1.0,2018,Arrived early and that worked fine as I got it installed with no problems.  It is working fine!
320946,1.0,2018,excellent
320947,-1.0,2018,"Forces you to create a Microsoft account AFTER you buy it. Amazon provides a serial number, but MSFT still forces you to create an account. That really mad me angry and I wanted to return it. Now, to install the product, MSFT is making me SIGN IN with that account. It is the first box that pops up when you start to install office. It forces you to login.

It says NOTHING in the description about requiring you to sign in with an MSFT account to use it. I do not appreciate this and want a refund."
320948,1.0,2018,Great for buisness
320949,1.0,2018,Great price.
320950,0.0,2018,"I kind of regret purchasing it. Have long been using Office 2010 Home & Business. Had a *glitch* with my Win10 desktop that forced a reinstall of the OS. As part of recovery process it removed all of my programs. Decided it was time to upgrade as my company is about to upgrade as well from Office 2010. So I bought the 64-bit version to run on the 64-bit OS.

In short, I don't like it. Some coworkers are running Office 2013 and compared to that, Office 2016 looks and feels clunky. I definitely do not like the changes to Outlook. Excel is fine. Word is so-so, and PowerPoint is fair. It's almost as if MS took a step backward here in an effort to push people toward a subscription-based model with Office 365."

320958,-1.0,2018,"I had Office 2010 and replaced it with this one. Each program is runs slower, the Macros do not run smoothly and OneNote is a JOKE! The only way I can run Onenoe is as administrator, but all the shortcuts in other programs (Word, Outlook, PowerPoint...) open OneNote to a non-administrator mode, which means it freezes upon opening.
The Macros pause at every Paste (of any kind) and I have to press continue in the Macro panel. Some of my Word Macros, I paste at least two times per day of the month (saying for every day), so on a 30 day calendar it pauses 60 times and I have to continue 60 times for each calendar I make. SLOW PRODUCTION!  To get help on these product they want to charge me over twice what I paid for the program. These are just a few of the problems with Office 2016, like icon placement, outlook problems, etc.
I am glad that car delaers, appliances, furniture, etc., are not like that on their new products. Can you imagine having a new car, where all the features did not work when you bought it and they want twice the price you paid for the car to fix it?
According to my research on the web, there are no cures for these problems."

320960,1.0,2018,The best part was I got to use it immediately. The not so good part was that one of my most liked features is no longer available.

Of course, as soon as I entered all the digits/letters required, I cross checked my input to ensure I had made no typos.  Finding none, I still have no access to the software I thought my payment to Amazon would give me.

320988,-1.0,2018,"I have been shopping for a newer version of Microsoft Office and I have one question for the board of directors of Microsoft. Just how far can your greed go? Bill Gates has more money than He, His wife, his Children, His Grand Children, In-Laws or his extended family could ever spend. The company could give all of their produces away for free for many years to come and never have to file for Bankruptcy. Now please don't miss-understand me, I have to work to support my family, and I have no problem with someone making a profit, If a business does not turn a profit they go out of business and that would not be a good thing, we need Microsoft. But come on people 98% of the people in just the United States alone are not Millionaires. Some where between 60% and 80% are not business owners and use your products for personal use or have to buy your products to augment their work or school life out of their own pocket. Think about what you are doing. It has been my experience especially growing up in a small town that a company that treats their customers with respect, that treats them like they want their business instead of like we owe you our money and offers a good product for a reasonable price gets the business. And the companies that are over priced or has low class service or offers a faulty product goes out of business. With that said: I need Microsoft Office for myself, for my Wife and Son who are both students but I will not be purchasing Office 2016 because you have priced yourself right out of my league. I have the money but I will not give you what you are asking for this product.

320989,0.0,2018,"Although I am content with the product itself, I was disappointed that I had to call customer service to assist me with the download.  Apparently, although I downloaded the product successfully, my computer did not recognize the Office 2016 installation.  Rather, it recognized the free Office 365 that came with my new computer.  As a result, I kept receiving a message that I had an ""unlisenced product.""  Thus,  I could not open any of the Office products.  I attempted to use the on-line help, to no avail, so I called customer service.  A representative assisted me immediately; however, it took 1 hr. 33 min. to download Office on a brand new computer.  Both Office 365 and 2016 had to be removed, then Office 2016 was reinstalled."

After several updates, the program just completely became nearly inoperable. it freezes, the fonts are either too small to read or tool large for the space on the screen. Does not work well with my 4K monitor/cpu. A ton of bugs. I am hesitant to update because it seems like they might just let older versions break down so that consumers have to upgrade to the next version. Very disappointed in this product. I have been using Quicken for over a decade and never had any problems like i have with this version (2016)."

323247,1.0,2018,good product.
323248,-1.0,2018,Turns out Quicken wants you to repurchase what is essentially the same product every three years.  No reason - the 2016 version is nearly identical to the 2013 version and the 2019 version that undoubtedly I'll be forced to buy will be the very same product.

The program works fine, with only the minor occasional quirk. What has pushed me away from Quicken are the incessant UPGRADE NOW pop-up messages. The pop-up appears periodically at startup and won't let Quicken load until you close the pop-up. It's *really* annoying when I'm pressed for time and need to make a quick entry. I'm in the process of looking for something less intrusive, less expensive, that fits my needs better."
323251,1.0,2018,Been using Quicken for years. Most recently 2016 version. It works well although at times it has some glitches when working with the budget functionality.
323262,1.0,2018,Works good
323263,-1.0,2018,"I've used Quicken for over 25 years.  In the past I described Quicken as one of the best designed software packages I'd seen.  It was intuitive and easy to use. Often when working with professional database designers I used Quicken as an example of what they should strive for - simple, intuitive and easy to use.

I decided to upgrade from the 2013 version to the a more current version.  After I purchased this version I discovered they changed the way you interact with the product and took away your anonymity.  You are required to have an online account and agree to a nineteen page terms of use. I talked with their support department and there isn't an opt out option.  Those are beyond what I'm willing to accept to manage my finances.  I uninstalled this version and went back to the 2013 version."
323264,0.0,2018,Too difficult to use unfortunately
323266,-1.0,2018,"I cannot believe Amazon would sell this product.  I can load it on the computer, but cannot not open it or login to Quicken. I have followed all the support suggestions. It appears I'm not the only one with this problem.  I've used Quicken for many years and have been satisfied in the past.  Last version was on Vista and it always worked fine.  This version is worthless and from what I've read 2018 isn't any better. Just threw $45 down the drain.  I sure cannot recommend this to anyone."
323267,1.0,2018,Works great and I use it for all my bill paying.
323268,0.0,2018,"I have been a Quicken user for at least twenty years. The latest policy to force an upgrade every two years for a similarly unstable product is becoming unpleasant. I tried Moneyspire but it could not convert all my data a few years ago. Maybe newer versions will work better, as the bad press I have heard about Quicken users dealing with incompetent techies is becoming louder and louder, IMHO."
323269,-1.0,2018,"I have been a Quicken user for years, ever since Microsoft Money went away and my data file is over 20 years old.  Currently I have the 2016 version, but have invested hundreds of dollars in upgrades over the years.  Why does Quicken constantly corrupt my data file?  It is beyond frustrating and not a new phenomena.  Linked accounts get broken, I've got stuff transferred to [unspecified account]'s, the cloud sync never works and downloads from financial institutions that once worked, work no more.

The only the thing that corrupts my data file is Quicken itself and then I have to be the one to spend hours trying to fix it with their tools that don't work.  Either that or restore from a backup and have to redo everything from that point.  Every time it starts up, it asks me if I want to upgrade to the new version even though I uncheck the remind me later box.  Why should I continue to spend good money after bad?  The problems never get fixed!  If there was a half decent competitor, I would have abandoned this program years ago, but no one else has the same functionality.

I posted a similar post on the Quicken site with numerous replies from users similarly dissatisfied with no where else to go.  I posted the following reply to a fellow user on the site and it was subsequently removed by Quicken.

""I am a software engineer by trade.  This is a Quicken problem.  What other program, application, etc. do you know of that has a ""Validate and Repair"" function?  This is because changes and updates are not thoroughly tested and ensure backwards compatibility.  Have you ever tried to delete or cut and paste a transaction or do a merge of duplicate transactions and they disappear from the register of the linked account?  Happens all the time to me.  It's a simple function that they can't seem to get straight.""

The message from the Quicken moderator stated that this comment was ""off topic, misinformation, not constructive with criticism"".  Sure I was being critical of the product, but I can't help but wonder why, rather than deleting my comments, they didn't challenge my critique with facts that contradict my claim.  It is because they can't.

The product is challenged, full of bugs, and self-inflicted issues and errors that are a result of a poor testing.  Research any review of this product and you will see I am not alone in my criticism of the product."
323272,1.0,2018,It's Quicken! It works well! Love how easy it is to download transactions form the bank and credit card!
323273,-1.0,2018,"Like other versions of Quicken I've had, it started out okay, but after a year or so the bugs in the software made it all but worthless for tracking. And, there were no fixes anywhere on the Quicken sight (or elsewhere) to address. For instance, overtime there was this error [501 something or another] that indicated it was a quicken problem, but it never got fixed and spread to other accounts. I even did a complete reload of the software and imported an early backup file that seemed to be working at the time, but to no avail beyond just screwing up all my account balances. I have no reason to think it wouldn't happen with more recent software. There are other nice options on line that now do a better job and are free! They are not stand-alone like Quicken so that is less than optimal but so much easier to deal with. I have a feeling Quicken is not long for this world, especially after moving to a subscription based model. You have to be kidding. No way!"

330392,1.0,2018,"It took awhile to get receive the card, but I think that was my fault. I think I should've clicked on download instead of key card. Once I received it, it was easy to install. I've used Norton for years, and so far, it's never let me down."

331664,1.0,2018,I've always had positive experiences using Norton Internet Security.  It's saved my PCs from malware intrusion attempts on several occasions.
331673,1.0,2018,just like i expected
331674,1.0,2018,"Protects me from viruses, etc. throughout the year."
331675,-1.0,2018,"The key provided with this Norton Security package triggered a bogus error that led me to a person that tried to extort $149.99 for the purpose of removing ""hacking software"". The BS meter went crazy and I did not go for it. Instead I went directly to Norton and purchased from them to upgrade my security. No problem. Do  not buy this, you will have to buy it again when the ""error"" message appears."
331676,1.0,2018,"Ok first things first, i bought this and had it delivered to Jamaica, it didn't work right away and the problem was that it was not for my country so i contacted Norton and they fixed that easily, the delivery was on time and the product works really good, it even found a KEYGEN on its first scan. I give it an ""A"""
331677,1.0,2018,excellent
331678,1.0,2018,it was a pleasure to make this deal
331679,1.0,2018,As far as I'm concerned this is the best security protection for me.

331682,1.0,2018,"This highly rated security package installed easily on both Windows 7 and Windows 10. I had to contact (via chat) their tech support to get it installed on my MacBookPro, but they were able to help me do so. NSD runs well and updates itself beautifully."

331795,1.0,2018,Im give it a 5 star but I have only had it for a week but will get back if I see its not doing good
331796,1.0,2018,"Easy to download and easy to use. As far as effectiveness, I can only assume that it is working- I've never gotten a virus with it!

After logging into my account, I registered the number and then all other devices I could just log in (rather than remember the security code for each). This is nice because I don't have to keep the box and fumble around with it. Because of this, though, it might be nice if Norton could just email the security code in the first place rather than wasting the paper/cardboard to send it?"
331797,1.0,2018,Got this for a great price on prime day and love it
331798,1.0,2018,Have to figure out how to use it.

331811,1.0,2018,Great product and great price!
331812,1.0,2018,"Its Norton what more can I say. Have been using Norton AV or System Utilities since the mid 90s and I haven't had a infection yet. My only gripe about it is the blanket detection rule, it is understandable to error on the side of caution for most users, the software can make it hard to restore a known to me good file.
When it goes on sale its worth picking it up even if I have half a year left in my subscription."
331813,0.0,2018,Slowed down computer too much.
331814,1.0,2018,"Great price, for great protection."
331815,1.0,2018,"Using Norton for years...works as well as any on the market, and updates are clean. The system does slow down your PC significantly while it runs in the background performing tasks.  Suggest when you log onto your PC, to put the software to sleep for the day while using your PC...  this software is not needed on iOS, or Apple devices. Only for Microsoft and Chrome devices...  Norton need to offer a software for two devices at a lower price point... as I have one MIcrosoft PC and laptop...The other devices or Apple and not required, which leaves to waste, 3 more devices that you have paid for."
331816,-1.0,2018,I bout it on deal of the day. For more than norton sight. I didn't have a cd drive. Whoops. Returned it and got one dollar thirty two cents back. Also have to reiderate my review from bad mouthing
331817,-1.0,2018,"Wasn't able to download and it's not supported by Norton. How do I get a refund (it wasn't used, but I had to wait until my original subscription expired before trying it out, so the refund period had expired; I think, nonetheless I am entitled to a refund!)."
331818,-1.0,2018,"When I attempted to download the product using the key code, the screen immediately requested that I call Norton Customer service. The install program did not even attempt to download and install the service, the request to call came up as soon as I entered the last digit of the code.
I am too busy to mess with returning it, so I will eat the 19.99, but there should be no requirement to speak with Customer Service overseas, where they pay the workers very small wages and no benefits! A software company this big should pay working wages to all their employees."
331819,-1.0,2018,Wow how shady.  My code wouldn't work after 3x trying it so I had to call in.  They wanted access to my computer after giving them tons of private info.  I finally said no and would return it.  They then said to try entering the code again myself and it worked just fine.  BE CAREFUL!
331820,0.0,2018,Keeps saying product key no good

331822,1.0,2018,ok
331823,1.0,2018,Nice and effective installation. Doesnt slow down pc at at all. I have $200 simple 2 yrs old laptop and this has not slowed that down even a little bit.
331824,1.0,2018,"I bought this on Prime day, and actually got it for less than the purchase price, so this was a great price for this product!  I am glad I purchased it, and it is good for 5 of our devices.  There is a lot to set up, but since it is the Deluxe version, I didn't mind at all!"

331835,-1.0,2018,Don't even consider it.  This program will cause chaos on your computer.  It doesn't work and all they will do if you have any issues is return what money you paid for the program?  AVOID THIS PRODUCT - Nothing but trouble.
331836,1.0,2018,Much needed
331837,-1.0,2018,This item was aready used. I could not put it on my computer.
331840,-1.0,2018,I received an empty envelope. There was nothing in it
331841,-1.0,2018,"When my husband typed in the key card code a message appeared telling us to call Norton as there was a problem that was preventing him from loading the code. My husband spent the next two hours thinking Norton was fixing malware and even agreed to $150.  We now know these people were thieves. Thankfully, after hanging up, the thieves got greedy and called back saying they wanted to refund our money and asked for our bank account number.....my husband immediately unplugged the computer.  Long story short, we cancelled our credit card and was refunded all cost. We are elderly and not the shapest techies, but these thieves were really good at duplicating Norton ""help"". We spent a lot of time getting to the real Norton people who then ran scans to clean our computer  If we had incurred any big.loss, we feel Norton would be responsible.  Was this code corrupted already when manufactured in Singapore?  Does Amazon care we purchase the software from them?  Thieves should be shot in the towm square THEY ARE RUINING OUR LIVES!!"
331842,1.0,2018,Great price for 5 devices
331844,1.0,2018,We have used Norton for years and have always been pleased. Great price.

331855,1.0,2018,"I always have Norton on my devices but last year there was a great prime deal on McAffee - it was priced much lower then Norton and others so I decided to give it a try)
Well... Now I'm very happy about getting back to the Norton :)
I don't saying that I got some virises ect with McAffee. No! It did a good job on protecting my devices so they didn't catched anything harmful... However, McAffee loves to pop on the screen its window with all the information on how many treats was caught etc... And this screen comes out almost everyday at random times: when I turn my device on as well as anytime through the day. Which is very annoying for me especially when there is no way to stop those messages from appealing...:(
By the way, Norton has similar messages coming onto device's screen but user has option to unmark them in settings so they won't appear on the screen:) Which I love!"
331856,1.0,2018,Works as expected.
331857,1.0,2018,"This is a product key code that is delivered to your door, it is NOT a cd-rom so don't worry if your laptop doesn't have a cd rom drive....you don't need it. It's just a code."
331858,1.0,2018,"I have used Norton in the past. Two years ago I changed over to Trend Micro. The issue I had with Trend Micro was it sucked up too much CPU on my PC and slowed everything down. I recalled never having a problem like that with Norton so I went back. I installed it a few days ago and it works like a charm, not depending on my PC's resources to the point of slowing down my machine."
331859,1.0,2018,I have used Norton for years and am quite satisfied.
331860,1.0,2018,good
331861,1.0,2018,I like Norton internet security will order again

331867,1.0,2018,Great product.
331868,1.0,2018,Great computer security and a good value.
331870,1.0,2018,"I have read several reviews of those who do not like the nagging messages about renewing Norton when you still have more than two weeks on your current subscription.  I bought this key card and chatted with an Indian rep.  At his end, he just asked for the 20-some character code, and he extended my subscription by 380 days from today; the remaining 14 plus 366.  I know that this took a few minutes of my time on chat, but the end result was I did not lose any days.  I am about to go on a vacation, lasting more than 14 days.  The result of the chat was all I wanted.  If you do not mind a little chat time, there can be no complaint about losing days of paid subscription.  I am satisfied.  I strongly recommend chat rather than trying to understand a random overseas person who truly does not speak and understand English well enough to avoid having to repeat and reword what you are saying and asking the overseas person to do the same.  When I asked a question on the telephone that the woman did not have an answer for, there was a lot of wasted time for her to ask a less ignorant person.  Telephone support is a weak link in the Norton system"
331871,1.0,2018,"Works well, easy to install"
331872,1.0,2018,"Be careful with this. I ordered this and when I typed in the website I received an error message stating that I had to click on the link to repair the error. A Norton webpage came up with a phone number to call. I did and a person said that it would cost $129. to fix. I called Norton antivirus and they told me that it was a scam, So they helped me install the program. If you get a error message when trying to install the program call Norton Symantec."
331873,1.0,2018,Does the job without bothering me to make decisions.
331874,1.0,2018,Like it. Thanks.
331875,1.0,2018,Great for home use
331876,1.0,2018,perfect and works easily

331879,1.0,2018,grea key cardt
331880,-1.0,2018,Wanted buy that Norton didn't work call the800  number and they didn't helped me
331886,1.0,2018,it is what it is
331887,-1.0,2018,"If you like a product that relentlessly nags you to buy their other products (ripoff LifeLock), then you will love Norton. I wouldn't mind if they asked me once but they ask almost everyday and you have to close the marketing window each time. It is terribly annoying and Norton seems to think that they will eventually break you down so you will pay for a subscription to their overpriced product. They are as bad an any telemarketer. Microsoft's Defender free antivirus is starting to look real good if only to stop the relentless marketing harassment by Norton."
331888,0.0,2018,"Norton Security Deluxe seems to do the job of protecting my PC from various security threats, including those on websites that one might have expected were safe such as yahoo.com. However, I am disappointed with the intrusiveness and overhead of Norton:
* Norton generates pop-up windows that are basically trying to sell the LifeLock product while potentially giving some people the impression of a red flag needing attention.
* My browser keeps flagging the Norton/Symantec add-on as slowing down performance and something that it suggests disabling.
* The are also other indications of degraded performance, which I did not see with Kaspersky.

If it weren't for the concern about Kaspersky's Russian connection, I would definitely prefer to go back to Kaspersky."
331889,1.0,2018,Good product - would recommend!
331892,1.0,2018,Need to have security!
331893,1.0,2018,"Works well,  but was a little quirky to get the account to accept code when you have an existing coverage. You need to let that coverage expire."
331894,1.0,2018,Excellent product & Great price
331895,1.0,2018,Norton fan here!
331896,1.0,2018,as always a great protector.

331904,0.0,2018,"Buyer Beware, the five device key card that I received had been hacked and instead of one year it only had 226 days remaining on that code. Looking closely it appears the card had been opened before shipment. I could have easily have used it and not noticed that I did not get the full 365 day renewal.  I had the 226 days returned to the code and I am returning it to Amazon."
331905,1.0,2018,I'll be looking for the next one and am hoping for another black friday special like this one.
331907,1.0,2018,so far so good.

331909,1.0,2018,Easy to install using website.
331910,-1.0,2018,It took extraordinarily long time to load after several aborts(Norton site will not respond). Similar problem with the second device. I returned the product.
331911,1.0,2018,it worked well
331913,1.0,2018,"If you're familiar with Norton Security, then you know what you're getting.  If Norton is already installed on your device, then just use the Key Card inside to continue your coverage.  It's that easy."
331914,1.0,2018,Took less than 5 minutes to install and I was protected for another year. Great price too!
331915,1.0,2018,"Fast delivery, good product !"

331920,1.0,2018,"Great price, worked perfectly fine on all devices"
331921,1.0,2018,Works great.
331922,-1.0,2018,"Couldn't use it. I had Norton previously on my computer, and removed it so I could put this new one on, or at least I thought I did. I called the Norton help hotline on the box, however they didn't seem to know how to solve the issue without remote access to my computer....which I was unwilling to do. When I told them I wasn't comfortable with that and could they walk me through, they read same exact directions as on the box as to how to install it.  So, I basically spent 40 some bucks for nothing.  The odd part is that it seemed to load onto my computer, but the problem arose when I went into the Norton account, it would then delete the new virus protection. I tried and tried, evntually gave up. Should be easier to wipe out old antivirus when you are replacing it with a newer version.  I didn't feel like Norton help was any help.  although they claimed they could help, the only way they seemed to be able to was with remote access.  It seemed as though this was an occurring problem, not just me."
331924,1.0,2018,Good price and always have trusted norton to keep my computers and phones safe.
331925,1.0,2018,Works like it's supposed to.

331927,1.0,2018,good price! works great for 10 pc's
331928,1.0,2018,Works great.  Best security
331929,1.0,2018,"Loading software on several devices went smoothly.  Has many optional features to keep me safe while online.  However, the maintenace feature (e.g., disk optimizer, file cleaning) is just adequate."
331930,1.0,2018,Great price for what I consider the best anti-virus program out there. I have used many others but Norton's has been on the majority of my computers for over two decades.
331931,1.0,2018,The package arrived on time. It was the right item and it came in the right size package
331932,1.0,2018,"Have used Norton for many, many years.  It's a great product and the price is GREAT. I will never purchase my renewals automatically from Symantec anymore when I can SAVE lots of money through Amazon."

I read many negative review about the Norton Customer service when peoples contact them.
But i don't have any choice i already purchase $50 worth of program that would be worthless, so i contact by chat to the Norton Customer service and tell them my issue.
Then they give me the other Product key that can activate my purchased program. I have to tell this that in my experience the Norton CS is very professional and helpful to me instead of any negative feedback.so thanks Norton

331962,1.0,2018,Good value
331963,1.0,2018,it works excellent
331964,1.0,2018,Needed it.
331966,0.0,2018,This product is just okay didn't see big help with it
331967,1.0,2018,I love Norton's AntiVirus. I have been using it on my computers for 11 years. I wouldn't use any other product. Lately however I have had to reload it on one of my laptops at least 5 times. They make it easy though so I can't complain. This software is The BEST!
331969,1.0,2018,"Unlike its major competitor the Norton install, re-install and addition of other devices work like a charm.  Install on the competitor beginning with an ""M"" is just awful.  The 10 device license (if you need more than 5) was well priced right and works well.  It has stopped 3 ransomware attacks."
331970,1.0,2018,"Easy to load, even more convenient to ""push"" out to other PCs using the same previously license over the internet using Norton's website.  My daughter is away at college and all she needed to do was turn it on and have an internet connection.  I updated her Norton from my PC at home.
 Nice to have a solid all in one anti-virus, firewall, etc."
331971,1.0,2018,Description implied Norton utilities included they are not. Still good price.
331972,-1.0,2018,"Need type in the key when download the software and type the key again when install. After installation, everything works fine for a few hours. Then it complained license expired, and have to type in the key again to activate it."
331973,1.0,2018,Good protection.
331974,1.0,2018,"My Norton Security Premium has worked out very well for me; it deals effectively with malware and did so last year as well. The provision of 10 licenses allows my purchase to satisfy the needs of myself, my daughter, my son-in-law, and my grandson. Norton Security Premium offers an excellent combination of effectiveness and economy."
331975,1.0,2018,good
331977,-1.0,2018,I was never able to use the software.  Norton support blocked the software claiming my system had a virus even after it was repair by tech. They wanted access to my system. They are holding me up for ramson.
331978,1.0,2018,perfect
331979,1.0,2018,works great.
331980,-1.0,2018,"ordered and upon entry of the code, says invalid.  no refund through amazon as it's expired.  Believe manufacturer should reimburse me or provide another code."
331981,-1.0,2018,"Purchase this when on sale-tried to use it today and the product key was expired. Big rip off!!!! Now the return window is closed and can not return.
  Do not buy as it is worthless. I have purchased this before on Amazon and no problems"
331983,1.0,2018,love this product
331984,-1.0,2018,"When this product was delivered to me, there was no disc in the box. Instead I was directed to Norton's web site where I was told that I had to let the person I talked to get to my computer. He told me that I had 64,000 error messages and to remove them to install the software, I needed to purchase additional protection for $179 to $369. What a con."
331988,1.0,2018,"great product, great Price!"
331989,1.0,2018,Its a Norton product and it stands up to Norton's good name. Easy to install and use on multiple items that need security. Will purchase renewal next year. As with any Norton product follow prompts when installing and if you check for auto renewal it will charge your card and update your product when the subscription is about to expire. Just make sure you check in your Norton account if you need to shut off auto renewal.
331990,1.0,2018,Great value!
331991,1.0,2018,I always use Norton and have never been disappointed.
331992,1.0,2018,Have been using Norton for years and will continue to do so.
331993,1.0,2018,I use Norton for years now and never had any issues with them.
331994,1.0,2018,Best value available for an outstanding product.
331995,1.0,2018,Get a new one and very year hear is where I can find the best price
331996,1.0,2018,good price
331997,1.0,2018,Norton security is the best Ive found for windows. Used it for years
331998,1.0,2018,"Great Security, Amazon shipped as promised, worked great. Another nice job!"
332000,1.0,2018,"I good buy, easy to set-up."
332002,1.0,2018,The  cost online is outstanding!!!!  I have been using Norton Security since 1995 and it is the best security on the market.
332003,-1.0,2018,"Do not use!!!  I bought this to use on a brand new computer.  When I typed in the keycode  (to get it started) it said I had to call their 800 number because there was a problem.  I called the number and they went on to say my brand new computer was being hacked and that I needed to purchase $200 to get rid of it, meanwhile the gained access to my computer because I thought they were helping me and a legitimate company.  They were trying to sell protection under Microsoft.  I said wait a minute who do you work for.  He wouldn't answer and wouldn't take no for a answer.  I am so upset.  Buyer beware!!!"
332004,1.0,2018,NoT BAD!
332005,-1.0,2018,"I called to get infro on why it wouldn't install on my computer, and the person on the phone not only looked through all of my browsing history and was making rude/intrusive remarks on certain websites, he also tried to tell me that my FL studio was a virus.  That wasn't the end of it though, he also installed a program on my computer which gathered info on all of my passwords, and then he tried to scare me into buying some sort of password security program to protect all my passwords.  When I said ""No thanks, I don't want the add-on""  he kept pushing for it, and kept trying to scare me into buying it, ""No thanks"" I said, again.  He then said he can no longer help me and just ended the call!  I returned this product and got my money back IMMEDIATELY!  This was the most ridiculous form of support I have ever received and not only will you not get any type of support form this company, it will try detect programs on your computer that aren't even viruses and tell you they are!  Save your money and your time, go with something else."
332006,-1.0,2018,"Tech support is terrible.  These kids are from India and their training is substandard at best.  They have ruined my computer. Furthermore, when I have tried to connect with Norton's, they lie because they think Americans are stupid (thanks to the media)....Asked to speak to a supervisor,was transferred to a person saying he was a supervisor, then on remote, there was another technician who lied to me, then he said he would transfer me to another technician.  Then I tried to call. This 15 minute return call has been almost an hour.  THEN I tried to find a physical address in the states, and for the life of me I cannot find one.  This is not my first rodeo with Tech Support, and it is now all the same.  The give away words/phrases are ""No Worries,"" --.dead giveaway to WORRY.  Next give away is ""Just relax, I will take care of you,"" meaning I am about to screw up computer.  I have always had Norton's on this computer and my previous computers, but any company with Poor Tech Support is Bad News. I am so frustrated, disgusted, and outdone.  Do yourself a favor and buy something else.  Norton's is no longer the company it once was.  Yay, outsourcing."
332007,1.0,2018,"I've been using Norton Security (aka Norton Internet Security) for many, many years. Actually, it's the only computer security product that I've used in all of my years of computer ownership. This should tell you something...I've never, ever had a virus on any of the computers that I've owned. Years ago, it did tend to slow my computer a bit, but over the last five or six years, great improvement with no slowdown whatsoever! Thank you, Symantec, for making the web a much safer place. By the way, Norton Security automatically scans every download.

This product also has an ""Identity Safe"" which remembers all of your user names and passwords. It automatically fills in this info when logging in to a website. You can print a copy of all user names and passwords as well if you back them up to a CSV file.. You can use Microsoft Excel or a similar product for this.

Norton Security Premium also has a back up feature, but I've never used it because I have a wonderful external hard drive that keeps all of my files safe and sound. Therefore, I can't say anything about that feature. However, it's probably a good idea to back up one's file to the web..An external drive can go bad go course.

To sum up, I heartily recommend Norton Security!"
332008,1.0,2018,Great product.
332009,-1.0,2018,It didn't work for 10 devices.
332010,1.0,2018,great deal
332011,1.0,2018,Yes like it alot to protect my computer
332012,1.0,2018,best product with cheap price bought multi-pack for our business
332013,1.0,2018,"Protects my 10 devices!  Works as designed for PC, iPhone, and Android phones."
332014,1.0,2018,"I've always used Norton, it was recommended by my PC guy. It's simple but seems to do the job and the price on Amazon was better than anywhere else at $27.99. I'm guessing that the price will fluctuate so you'll need to watch it."
332015,1.0,2018,I've had Norton Security for years and will continue to buy. I've never had any problems no matter what system I was running at the time which now is windows 10. Highly recommend it.
332016,1.0,2018,"Love Norton, have had it for years!"
332018,1.0,2018,This product catches more intrusions than other security product I've used and it costs less.
332019,1.0,2018,Great price ... Great quality
332020,0.0,2018,"They broke Identity Safe with their newest update (they removed the option to have the passwords stored locally on the PC, and now force user to save it to the cloud).  However, it doesn't work.  It's been weeks now, and no fixes.

A similar thing happened about a year ago with Firefox, and it took them over 6 months to fix it.  I have been a long-time user of Norton (1994), but I will not be renewing my license with them next year."
332021,1.0,2018,It was what as described.
332023,1.0,2018,"Received the item I ordered and it works fine, thanks."
332024,1.0,2018,Very good price for this. Very fast shipping.
332025,1.0,2018,"works good, just slows down the computer, but Norton always does that"
332026,1.0,2018,Can be a little intimidating with multiple imbedded menus.  Other than that it is a very good product.
332027,1.0,2018,Love that I can add all my devices on one account.
332028,1.0,2018,Glad I bought it!  It works great!
332029,1.0,2018,EXCELLENT. THANKYOU!
332031,-1.0,2018,Its a memory hog!! Hate all the pop ups ...I wamt a security system that works quietly in the background & omly notifies me when something needs my attention.
332032,1.0,2018,The Best there is!
332033,1.0,2018,great product
332034,0.0,2018,Wasnt up to much
332035,1.0,2018,Works well
332036,1.0,2018,works fine.
332037,1.0,2018,Im using it for years. Works great.
332038,1.0,2018,make sure you put in the right address or the product actually fights itself. meaning i have norton with 3 days left well it wouldnt accept the new down load as it is 365 days. so i had to call the company and wait for a tech to call me back but by that time i put in the correct address even though i thought i put in the right one there are too many norton ads and web crawlers screwing up the works.
332039,1.0,2018,The industry standard at its best. Have used for over 30 years and it's never failed me yet.
332040,-1.0,2018,I tried to load. Support guy got mad at me. Locked my computer for 10 minutes because he was mad. I will not use this product after that support guy locked my computer. I want to return it
332041,1.0,2018,have been using it for years and seems to work fine
332043,-1.0,2018,"I'm sure that it works well. My problem is that Pop up ads from Norton keeps showing up. You already have my money, I paid for the service. This was not a free product. I don't want to see more of the company ads. I don't even want to think about viruses, etc. I'm ok with shelling out money once a year for all of my computers and family's computers for the service of not having to think about those issues and for everything to work just fine... and here we are...

Ironically enough, I became a Norton customer about 12 years ago because I wanted to block Pop-ups from websites in the early 2000's. It has come full circle, and they have lost a customer"
332045,1.0,2018,Good product
332046,-1.0,2018,I was under the impression that there would be a CD of this items and it wasn't.  Therefore I would have to download it from an area where I could get internet service
332047,1.0,2018,Great product and very easy to install.
332048,1.0,2018,needed for security...
332049,1.0,2018,Best way to keep up your subscription
332050,0.0,2018,"I purchased this unit to service (2) two computers and when I tried to install it on a second computer I was told the product would NOT WORK on the Windows 7 Professional system and that I would have to pay $185 dollars to have it ""worked on"". Three times I tried and same result Each Time!! They even ""Hung up On me"" when I asked WHY?"
332051,1.0,2018,I love it.
332052,1.0,2018,I trust Norton for my computer security.
332053,1.0,2018,Good price for NIS Premium for all of my computers and cell phones for 1 year.
332056,1.0,2018,"Great software, needed to call Norton for help with product key but everything is good and Norton is a great company to work with."
332058,-1.0,2018,"Spent an hour on the phone with Norton tech trying to load the software with no success. They then said my wifi was hacked and then they said the could fix problem with a new software that would cost another $300 to $700 I'm totally disgusted with all to with the product , used Norton many times in past, this is like a bait and switch. scam. They then changed owner email., product had to be deleted from my mac"
332060,1.0,2018,"I have been a Norton/Symantec consumer for at least 20 years now.  When I renewed my software last year, I purchased the Security Premium software.  It worked great.  In searching for new software to purchase when my subscription would be expiring soon, I decided to go back to Security Deluxe mainly because I don't need the extra features that Premium has such as protection for kids, etc.  When time to update my subscription came, I logged into my Norton/Symantec account and followed directions that came with this Norton Security Deluxe package.  All went well and I was able to also download on a couple other of my devices as well.  Once downloaded onto all devices I need it on for now, I did do the Live Update feature so it would bring the software up to date.  I recommend anyone purchasing any Norton product that is not directly downloaded from the Norton website to run the Live Update so software is up to date.  I then did a quick scan and my devices were brought up to date and my days remaining in my subscription were updated properly as well.  When  using this product to update or continue your subscription, I do recommend that you wait until just a day or two before your Norton subscription's current expiration date to download the new software.  That way you should not lose any days in your old subscription that you are updating.  For me, this program is sufficient and efficient for my needs.  I didn't use the Norton Cloud backup in the old subscription/Premium software (I prefer to do external hard drive back-ups) & no kids to protect from Internet.  Just depends on what your required personal needs are whether you use Security Deluxe or Security Premium version of Norton software.  Lastly, I installed this on a computer that came with Windows 10 and my other devices are computers with the free Windows 10 upgrade.  This product worked on all the computers I installed it on using Windows 10."
332061,1.0,2018,"Great product that I have used for many years. Symantecs customer service was proficient in integrating my existing, unexpired subscription into the new subscription. This gave me a credit for several extra months.

So, If you renew your subscription before its expiration, you will lose its remaining time  it will not be automatically added, You must call customer service. They will give you credit for the unused time. An annoying inconvenience at the very least."
332062,1.0,2018,great technical support
332063,1.0,2018,Protects our two PC's and I still can install it on 3 other devices. Good deal for adequate protection.
332064,1.0,2018,Seems to work very well and we use it all the time. I like that is is from a name I trust.
332065,1.0,2018,no problems. easy to use.  the customer service number with Norton was fast and effective
332066,1.0,2018,Have used for many years and what everyone wants to know and I can say affirmatively is *IT WORKS* and is easy to use
332067,1.0,2018,great pricing and so easy to get.
332068,1.0,2018,Love it
332069,1.0,2018,Fast Shipping! Works great!
332070,-1.0,2018,numbers were stolen from me before i downlaoded them from a hacker but was refunded the money
332072,1.0,2018,"Good protection. However, always trying to ecourage you to buy more protection."
332073,1.0,2018,"I like Norton security software.  But, after buying the 10 Device software, my installation process became a nightmare.  I had inadvertently allowed my Norton to expire when I tried to install the 10 Device software.  After about 70 minutes of failing to download the new software and connect to the Norton server, I finally contacted tech support through the Chat process for help.  I wound up with a regular techie and after another 1 hour & 20 minutes, a senior techie.  The software eventually downloaded after 3 or 4 updates and about 8 or 9 reboots but would not activate.  All in all, it took about 3 hours and 20 minutes to complete the installation process including eventual activation.  Both techies were surprised at my problem.  Both were, however, very helpful and patient.  But, if I ever have another similar installation situation, I will drop Norton security software.  The senior techie extended my subscription by 30 days as a good will gesture which I appreciate."
332074,1.0,2018,Great produce at fair price
332076,-1.0,2018,"My Kasperky expired, found norton for a good price. Absolute junk on windows 10. Went back with Kaspersky."
332077,1.0,2018,Easy to use comprehensive protection.
332078,1.0,2018,It is great we Dan use it on several computers.
332079,-1.0,2018,This would not install in my computer - a key # appeared along with a phone number to call to resolve the problem.  Mind you I already had Norton installed and just needed an update.  The Norton operator told me my computer was outdated and I needed to purchase tech support since I had none to the tune of $350 for 5 years.  I purchased my Dell from QVC with a lifetime support.  This is a scam folks beware!
332080,1.0,2018,the best
332081,1.0,2018,I received it yesterday. I was a great bargain at $24.99 for 5 devices.
332083,1.0,2018,Works great! Just plug in the product key and I was up and running.
332084,-1.0,2018,stay out of politics and make better software! never will buy another symantec product. nra life member.
332085,-1.0,2018,Crap.....there are better security products out there and for less money.
332087,1.0,2018,Quick delivery ... Great product!!!  A+++ Seller!!!  Thanks!!!
332088,1.0,2018,"We had been loyal Norton users for more than a decade with no issues.  This the first time we bought the 10 license product, therefore it is the first time we used Norton on a few of our mobiles and tablets.  Recently, Norton Mobile gave us a scare saying that our network is compromised.  I changed our wifi network names, made new and stronger passwords, updated everything in response.  It was a pain to update all our wifi devices again.  After this, we still showed network was compromised on our mobiles and tablets.  Our actual computers did not show any issue even after full system scans.  Needless to say we have stopped using Norton on our mobiles and tablets.  I still will likely stick with Norton in the future for our computers, but I will not buy the 10 license product anymore.  I have to take off two stars for this issue.

4/10/18. I am adding back one star for Symantec quickly acknowledging and addressing the issue.  I have re-installed Norton on our mobiles and tablets and everything seems to be fine.  I still trust Norton Security and will continue to buy it in the future."
332089,1.0,2018,good I like it
332090,-1.0,2018,Cloud backup doesn't work even after half a day on the line with product support.  Could have saved some dollars and a bunch of time with a lower version.
332091,0.0,2018,Well received my package today it was banged up. Hope the code wasn't used.
332092,1.0,2018,great price- once you activate all you need is the account information (email and PW to dl to other devices)
332095,-1.0,2018,"Serial number will not work.  Hassle, waste of time.  Purchase elsewhere."
332096,-1.0,2018,Don't ever buy anything Norton. They are deceitful rip-offs...
332098,1.0,2018,Great internet protection. One of the very best.
332099,1.0,2018,I've been using Norton for probably over 5 years without slowing down the computer and without any viruses taking it down.
332100,1.0,2018,we love Norton's security..
332101,1.0,2018,Norton does a great job at preventing hackers from intrusion. It's amazing how many try to invade your system. The older versions of Norton use to slow down the computer but this seems much a less problem now. Been using Norton for over a decade and will continue to use it.
332102,1.0,2018,Great price
332103,1.0,2018,works great
332104,0.0,2018,switched to mcaffee
332105,-1.0,2018,"Twice now norton has bricked my computers and I had to re-install and restore
from backup. It works on first install and then they force an auto update to newer engines and often
these are not compatible with you OS so your PC or laptop becomes
so destroyed programs will not start. Not even Microsoft system restore
will save you. The only thing that saves you is a full or system image backup.
If you don't have this you have to install the OS over again.

Norton outsources customer service to the lowest bidder and their support is terrible.
Takes forever to learn you have to revert to earlier additions until they fix their
bugs with newer releases.

*It slows down your pc a lot compared to other products

*auto renew is evil

*A install of a new Norton  product will often break other norton\symantec products."
332106,1.0,2018,Basic Norton package.  Good price
332107,-1.0,2018,"This might have been a good price and protected my computer, but it slowed it down so much that it was almost unbearable.  As soon as I removed it (and went to a different product), my computer sped back up. I guess it was worth a try, but that was Norton's last chance for us. We had had problems with Norton products in the past, but wanted to see if they improved at all and they didn't."
332108,1.0,2018,Worked awesome ty
332109,1.0,2018,"Norton want $100 for this protection and I could not get them to go below about $50.  This is cheaper, but you have to call them to add the time to your current license if you have one.  As for Norton, I think it stops all viruses, but it slows down your computer quite a bit sometimes,  It also is irritating about constantly reminding you to install parts you didn't want and I have found no way to stop it."
332110,1.0,2018,"Norton Security has always worked good for me over years, and so far so good."
332112,1.0,2018,Recently switched to the Norton Utilities and Anti Virus. I have previously used Kapersky and have been concerned with the overall concerns with recent hacking all over the world. I like the way that Norton interfaces with all of my applications and the ease of the Password securities. Much easier to use. also 10 devices is awesome for $30/ year such a great deal.
332113,1.0,2018,Good
332116,1.0,2018,works great
332117,1.0,2018,Norton customer for long time. No issues at all.
332118,1.0,2018,Great Product! Would recommend.
332119,1.0,2018,Can't beat the deal
332120,1.0,2018,Very easy to buy and install
332121,1.0,2018,Item as described.
332122,0.0,2018,"Install on the 1st PC was a snap. Norton then emails a link that is to be used for installations on additional computers. 2nd install from the link was a total pain. Tried the link. It failed. Installation error.  Used Norton Remove and Reinstall. Install failed again. After 4 tries, it finally worked. I think the problem may have come from whatever causes the popups re: Expired Subscription. It wouldn't go away, even after the new installation. Finally, it did, and I don't have a clue as to what I did for the fix. All OK now."
332123,1.0,2018,good price
332125,1.0,2018,"Every year, without fail, a good solution for those that have more that one home PC like me."
332127,1.0,2018,Easy to install but Norton would not recognize keyword it took 6phone calls and a lot of aggravation to do start up!  I don't think they like it th hat you get a great price from amazon  so they give you grief setting it up!
332128,1.0,2018,As advertized
332129,1.0,2018,Excellent
332130,1.0,2018,I dread having to upgrade these security and anti-virus' every year because I have no confidence in doing regular maintenance on a computer. This worked just like it should and easy to follow directions. Thank goodness over for another year.  Haaaaa!
332131,1.0,2018,The only Security product that I truly trust. !!!!!
332132,1.0,2018,I thought this was the premiere addition...

332134,1.0,2018,happy with the item thanks
332135,1.0,2018,delivery on time and product update perfectly easy
332136,1.0,2018,So far so good
332137,-1.0,2018,installed upon receipt and less than a month later had a notice my service was terminated and had to install a second time.
332138,1.0,2018,We use it every year.
332139,1.0,2018,Trusted Antivirus
332140,1.0,2018,My all time favorite security for all our devices and computers.  Easy to use. Has never failed me.
332141,1.0,2018,Great Norton product and number of devices for the right price.
332142,1.0,2018,Norton is the best. only issue  thought it came with cd/
332143,-1.0,2018,"Too many pop-ups, ads, spam - all Norton stuff but too annoying.  Don't give them permission to automatically renew, your anniversary comes and goes before you have a chance to leave them and find better.  I'm not certain they are the only cause for my PC slowing down, but they have a hand in it.  Their help desk is aggravatingly slow and although they did resolve my problem I had to trust them enough to give them full control. It was kind of scary watching someone I didn't know remote in and go through all your files.  It would have been easier to reload windows. They've become political now and think everyone should think like them - so they don't really need or care for my money,  they want business accounts so I'm not going to be missed -  but there are others that want it."
332144,1.0,2018,Was a great price and works good.  Only thing is if you put on product 2 months after first product the date of expiration begins with first installing.
332145,1.0,2018,"Good Deal, just wait to activate until your  old subscription is about to end"
332146,1.0,2018,Great deal for the value of this package.
332147,1.0,2018,Good protection
332149,1.0,2018,Norton is the whip it takes care of my PCs and my phones great job Norton
332150,1.0,2018,Best product on the market for computer security and a great price to protect 10 devices!
332151,1.0,2018,It's Norton - what else do you need to know?
332153,1.0,2018,Great product.  Been a Norton user for years
332154,0.0,2018,"I bought this product because of the trusted reputation of Norton (I'm assuming it is doing a good job protecting my computer), but what I didn't anticipate was the constant spamming by Norton. I'm constantly getting notifications from Norton trying to get me to upgrade my subscription, among other things. While streaming a 3 hour show through my laptop to my projector I had 3+ Norton notifications pop up for which I had to get up from my seat, walk back to my laptop, and manually close them. The frequent notifications of non-essential things has gotten irritating over the last 2 months. I thought Norton would just protect my computer in the background so I would only know it was there if something had gone wrong."
332155,1.0,2018,Great as always.
332157,1.0,2018,Best price!
332158,1.0,2018,It has worked great for our computer and I really like the fact that it can be download on up to 5 devices for the same price.
332159,-1.0,2018,"I had one user on my computer with a pop up box Malware message every time I logged in.  So I bought this Norton  Anti Virus Program However - This program did not check for malware ,  found no Viruses on my computer and left all three of my computer user names with a pop-up malware message after log in - instead of just the one.  Quick scan did nothing ,  A Full scan fu#k up my  registry and my computer ,  and I had to run Windows  System Restore to get it back the way it was .  Now I have extra  empty folders in my Pictures folder that came out of nowhere -  Looks like it's it's time to Format and start over again. Not happy !  ,  I might as well have drove down the road and threw money out my car window."
332160,-1.0,2018,"Norton security was going to expire in 10 days so I found the least expensive program at Amazon.  Arrived today.  When I tried to install it got a message it couldn't be installed and posted an 800 number on the screen to call.  Talked with that person, after allowing access for him,  for 20 or more minutes before he said I had multiple security problems with the wireless network and he could add a technician who could resolve the problem in two or three hours.  I asked how much that would cost and he said $249.  The spiel was so rehearsed I said no and called Best Buy.  Took it in to their geek squad, bought a WebRoot software for internet security.  Installed the program and it found 6 viruses.  Several problems with this.  I've had Norton security software (for years used 365) continuously on every computer I've owned for many, many years.  Their security apparently didn't protect my computer.  Was the number shown on the screen after trying to install actually Norton?  If not can't Norton have their software only post valid numbers?  Why should the cost go from $30 to $249 if their software was supposed to protect my computer? Will be asking for a return and refund."
332161,1.0,2018,Great deal
332162,1.0,2018,I've been with Norton for years . Never disappointed.
332163,1.0,2018,Good internet protection.
332164,1.0,2018,"I was a longtime user of anti-virus software emanating from somewhere near Moscow and liked the way it started up quickly and didn't hinder the performance of my laptop. Then I heeded warnings when I got a new laptop and went with a familiar US competitor whose founder seems a little kooky. I remembered why I didn't like it before: takes the laptop a while to crank up and get ready for the day. Then, on a whim after reading recommendations on here, I purchased this package for my nephews new laptop which is the same as mine. His works MUCH faster! At the end of my subscription with the competitor, Im switching to this."
332166,1.0,2018,Very good product was able to protect all my computers
332167,1.0,2018,Very useful and good price
332168,1.0,2018,"Soon, it will be time to renew it."
332169,1.0,2018,Norton security is a great product but the rebate system they use seem to be a ripoff to their loyal customers.
332170,1.0,2018,"love it, GREAT customer service."
332171,1.0,2018,I liked that Norton protected 10 devices!
332173,1.0,2018,"So far so good. I like Norton Security Premium. This makes me happy because it allows me to customised my preferences. It will also update my settings. Ive been having Norton Security for the last 7 years and I didn't have any problems at all. I can rely on this brand because I know that my computer is going to be safe from virus. My computer runs softly with this software. If you buy this on other website, it will be around $70-$80 for two devices. I bought the Norton through Amazon and paid only $30 for it for the whole year. You just have to shop around and wait for the perfect time when it is on sale.
Thank you Norton"
332174,-1.0,2018,No good
332175,1.0,2018,I get Norton Security every year and for 10 devices - you can't beat it.  Will do so next year.
332176,-1.0,2018,"I bought this, tried installing it and the code doesnt even work...very disappointed with the results."
332177,1.0,2018,Feeling safe
332178,-1.0,2018,it won't load on my computer
332179,0.0,2018,"Beware...this installation created a scam requesting $399 for assistance in removing a Trojan Horse (Torpig) that was alleged to have been on my I Pad. Fortunately, this was avoided by confirmation from a computer service."
332180,1.0,2018,Norton has saved my computer life more than once....and it continue to perform very well.  I have found no problems and no faults with the software in its current state.  Rock on Norton!
332181,1.0,2018,Very good value for a great security software. Alana Hoff
332182,1.0,2018,Good price for multiple electronics.

332189,1.0,2018,"Always use Norton, great price for multi computers"
332190,1.0,2018,I have used Norton for many years.  It has blocked many attempted attacks on my computer.
332191,1.0,2018,Haven't activated it yet as I'm waiting for my current NOrton to expire.  I've always used and trusted Norton.
332194,1.0,2018,"Been using Norton for years and have no complaints.  Gives me great protection at a great price. Easy to install, easy to renew."
332195,1.0,2018,"Norton has a nice security suite. It works well and it is intuitive. The anniversary date starts when you register the product, not when you install it. I gave away about 20 days, but the price from Amazon was really good."
332196,-1.0,2018,"There are too many pop-ups and notifications promoting their product. I do not want to reminded for Norton to manage my passwords. I can do this myself. At least once a week, there is some kind of notice selling their product."
332197,0.0,2018,Love the product but despise the constant notifications of them wanting me to read articles and to sign up for other products. I want a notification after a scan and when malicious activity is being noted and not for when you want me to buy more of your products twice a day.
332198,1.0,2018,Great buy and works well as usual.
332199,1.0,2018,Everyone in my family has used Norton Security for years and trusts the protection.

332210,1.0,2018,good
332211,1.0,2018,excellent security program
332212,1.0,2018,It works
332213,1.0,2018,just what I needed
332214,-1.0,2018,"Im from Guyana, South Ameria, when i sign in im getting an error, ""unable to activate?"
332215,1.0,2018,Norton user for years ...and several other of their products kept my DELL windows vista machine which is 10 yrs old now running like a clock.
332216,1.0,2018,Easy to use and install. Nice to be able to cover several of my devices without paying full price for each.
332217,1.0,2018,Great price & service.
332218,-1.0,2018,"This anti virus has regional lock ,  doesn't work outside US."
332219,-1.0,2018,"This didn't work on my computer I called Norton's IT people and was told I need to purchase a very expensive program from Norton to get it to work,
the program to get this one to run was more than 8 times the cost of this security program. I think it's just a scam, I packaged it back up and returned it to Amazon."
332221,1.0,2018,Seems to cover everything I need. Easy to use.
332222,1.0,2018,Easy to use. Everyone in the house can put it on there devices.
332224,1.0,2018,great internet protection and Amazon had it at a great price
332225,1.0,2018,I have been using Norton's Anti-Virus products for years and they have never failed me. A friend of mine who works as a security specialist for the US Government will only use Norton's products for his devices. Can't get a much better endorsement than that!
332226,1.0,2018,Quick to install
332227,1.0,2018,Ok
332228,1.0,2018,Everyone has their favorite internet security but I have been using Norton for years and I think they are the best. I use it combination with Malwarbytes. I've tried some of the others but they slowed down the system too much or they just weren't effective.
332229,1.0,2018,have been using this for years and will continue to buy.  don't install until your current protection runs out b/c it will start as soon as installed and any remaining time will be lost on your old protection
332230,-1.0,2018,I bought my product Nov 22 I installed on Jan 22. It says that it is a year protection and when I downloaded I says that I have only 206 days protection until I know a year is 362 days where it is that it says at the time of installation
332232,1.0,2018,As expected
332233,1.0,2018,Saved quite a bit on this product through Amazon. Was able to secure all my devices. The product key came fast and no problems downloading. Norton has kept our devices safe for many years and will buy again.
332234,1.0,2018,"Excellent product-- does the job without being intrusive, highly recommended!"
332235,1.0,2018,Most secure antivirus you can get I believe.
332236,1.0,2018,Norton's is the best. It's the only anti virus software that I use. Easy installation.
332237,1.0,2018,"It's antivirus.
It works like Norton antivirus normally works.
Just for 5 devices.

If you're not poking around shady parts of the internet Norton works pretty well to cover any threats you might be exposed to."
332238,-1.0,2018,This special is full of misleading information and attachments that are all geared toward getting you to upgrade by adding additional protection.
332239,-1.0,2018,mac users avoid. i bought this for my mac and it freezes and crashes my whole mac book. Mac users avoid. works fine on android (so far)
332240,1.0,2018,The product is operating as stated!
332241,1.0,2018,"Took awhile to install going from the 360 version but it worked. I bought this after several years of Norton 360. I was on ""auto renewal"" and never looked at prices. Norton was charging me $100 a year. So I decided to cancel the renewal and look for other options. I saw this deal on Amazon and the price was 80% cheaper. Crazy thing is they wanted me to renew my 360 for $50 after the fact that they were going to charge me double that on auto renew. I can't believe NORTON has not been sued for insanely price gouging people. They got me for several years but never again. On the flip side I have never gotten a VIRUS on any of my computers where Norton has been installed. $20 for 5 computers and mobile devices is a no brainer."
332242,-1.0,2018,I'm not happy with this virus protection too complicated for me. It changed my whole computer setup and It is slow and I just don't like it
332243,1.0,2018,The best virus protection.  Period.
332244,1.0,2018,It arrived as promise and Brand new.  It protect my computer as promise
332246,1.0,2018,great internet security
332247,1.0,2018,Pleasantly pleased!
332249,-1.0,2018,Suck! Virus still got through! Do not buy!!!
332250,-1.0,2018,"Why doesn't this work for me??! When I try to activate Norton it refuses the product key with an error message ""this product is not applicable for your region (2061)"". I lost already two months of activation without any security!"
332251,1.0,2018,Works as expected. Best AV on the market.
332252,1.0,2018,"My husband had a little trouble installing this because of the prior version we had. It works great, I gave it a 4 star because my husband had to contact customer support to get it installed."
332255,1.0,2018,"Great price!  10 devices,  Includes backup storage.
The real deal."
332256,1.0,2018,Really is protecting our devices !  I really trust Norton after trying so many other security programs. Best thus far over last several years. No complaints and super easy to understand and install.
332257,1.0,2018,I love it
332260,-1.0,2018,"Did NOT work. It's a fraud. Once you try to program it to your computer, it will say ""product key already activated AND IT'S FOR 10 DEVICES!!!"
332261,-1.0,2018,"This is The MOST Annoying anti virus I've ever used. Will never use anything but McAfee again.

Here's the Worst part, as life changing as the information makes this sound, you have to download a new App for everything.
Want it to clear junk. Download an app.
Want to see what it's done to protect ypur system. Download an App.

This is all in addition, to the download that initiates the ""Premium"" protection.
That's the small print they leave out.
It's all included but not on one program. Ugh!

Oh! The pop ups! Granted they are only from Norton but it is endless.
I am 2 months into a subscription, which I will not be renewing, and it asks me once a week to renew.
As well, ""Would I like to download Another App?"" to do what this one told me it would do, ""No, no I would not.""

The only place this excels is on a laptop.
But as this covers 10 devices, I think it's resonable to expect it would not be buggy on a phone or tablet.
If you have ten laptops due to a business or are just a hoarder (no judgement~ we all have our thing),
then this will work wondefully for you.

On my Android phone, I did download the 'Clean' app. My battery is deplted by the end of day.
My battery was Never depleted by end of day prior to Norton. Now, if I forget to charge at night, my phone it's dead by morning.
The most frustrating part about this is, it's running in the backround so, I can't even control the usage.

Then there's the fun little experience of, It Shut Down my ENTIRE Ipad OS.
Three years I've had my Ipad. Never once had the entire OS shut down to the point I had to set up from the beginning.
Fun right? Oh, yeah..
Even more when you forget your password and can't access your email to reset bc it's on the Ipad that has been shut down.
Thank goodness for the Lifewire site or I would have to go be judged by a 'Genius'.

The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is bc is bc so far, my devices haven't been hacked by Russians, but to be clear,
I truly hate this program."
332262,1.0,2018,great deal for this product--installed on all of my kids laptops and Surface Pro's
332264,1.0,2018,Good Black Friday deal.
332275,1.0,2018,"Great Price, and VERY easy to install."
332277,1.0,2018,GOOD
332278,1.0,2018,I have used Norton for years and I trust it. It installs easily on most devices but some can be a little stubborn.
332279,1.0,2018,Good!
332281,1.0,2018,Great product at good price.
332282,1.0,2018,Excellent product at excellent price

332305,-1.0,2018,"Hi! World the Seagate 10TB -R barracuda product is a complete DUD! A false advertised device that NASA can easily control its data service. I'm still testing it but so far, after Win10 Pro installation plus updates and more software downloads 10TB on my my hard drive systems data reads 1.99 TB of Free unused and 1.98 TB used space? Ahhhh Ohhh!! Microsoft! That means don't be fooled by the fancy aluminum outer case shell on SSD's either. Other than that, it runs fine.

Buyer, NMJ Global Industries"
332306,-1.0,2018,"Only works in the USA. Military stationed out of the continental United States can not use this version of Norton. Norton does not state these restrictions and when called, stated that if I had purchased directly from them, I would not have this problem.

Very poor policy and customer service!!!"
332307,1.0,2018,Norton has been my favorite security software for years.
332308,-1.0,2018,This item had only a 24 character product key and Norton requires a 25 character key. Must of been an old product on the shelf.
332309,1.0,2018,"Great price for 10 device protection.  You can now update/renew remotely once you set up each device on your norton account.  When the device goes online, which you can also see from the dashboard, you can renew the subscription with the key and the other person doesn't have to do anything on their end.  It's great if you have kids in school or older parents who you help with tech stuff, etc.  I would suggest labeling each device as you go when you do the initial set-up (mom's computer, joe's ipad etc) so you can quickly tell what needs to be renewed and who has that device. Norton has always worked well for my family and we particularly like the identity safe feature that manages the passwords."
332310,1.0,2018,Works well with my computers. Feel safer having it installed.
332311,1.0,2018,"big fan of norton, still the best."
332312,1.0,2018,Great security for the computer.
334377,-1.0,2018,"This was a repeat order of a good product, but what I received today was AN EMPTY ENVELOPE!"
334378,-1.0,2018,One of the main reasons I bought this was to use OneNote but apparently you cannot use OneNote without OneDrive. In other words you cannot create local Notebooks (like you can with the Windows version). You are forced to use Microsoft's cloud service.
334380,1.0,2018,perfect
334383,1.0,2018,"I like the product well enough.  It's just what it says it is - if you liked previous versions, you'll like this one."
334384,1.0,2018,Great office product for my new Macbook Pro
334385,1.0,2018,I need to up date my office software.
334386,1.0,2018,Good and easy to install
334387,1.0,2018,"As expected, works well for the mac"
334388,1.0,2018,It was touch and go trying to download but it eventually worked out. I will update if need be if theres an issue
334389,1.0,2018,Great price
334390,-1.0,2018,"Activation was not easy. YOU MUST uninstall old MSWord files first for anyone who is thiinking of buying this product.  THEN I was on the phone for over an hour with MicroSoft to give me digital keys and codes to install the program, and log into two of their support websites. What a pain, and a waste of valuable office time. No on change this process except MicroSoft. Just beware to set aside time to deal with installation."
334391,1.0,2018,Came in miniature box with key code and instructions inside.  Program and installation works as expected.
334392,1.0,2018,"I am very happy about my purchase of Microsoft Office Home and Student 2016 for Mac, although I did have to call Microsoft to help assist me in the set-up, but once I was set up, it has served me very well with my needs."
334393,-1.0,2018,I couldn't get it to install. It cost you 125.00  $ loss and me new software.why could.n't I get the disk to install?
334394,1.0,2018,Program contains a suite of Microsoft office programs that work well with the Mac.  The problem is that Microsoft give almost no information on how to install or use their product and no help number to call.  I called AppleCare and they were kind enough to help me install a rivals products.
334395,0.0,2018,"I don't know why, but I thought I was getting an actual DVD, as was done in the past for my all my MS Word for Mac versions, but it had been awhile and apparently it is now only available as a download, similar to the Office 365 subscriptions.  I just reread the Amazon description and it says nothing about this version being available only as a download and even talks about the size of the package, so wouldn't it be correct to assume a disk is being mailed??  I had just bought a new iMac, so I wanted to finally get a new version, assuming it would be good for awhile.  What concerns me is if I buy a new computer in a few years and there is a newer Word version that I do not want or need, I will not have the ability to load this current version to the new device (how long is ""lifetime"" access?).  The version I had been previously using was from 2011 and it was fine for my purposes.  I used that version a lot, but I no longer need to use Word as often as I am now retired, and also no longer doing the kind of volunteer work that required it.  I probably could do most of my work with Apple's own software, but because I am more familiar with Word's features, I went for that, assuming I would be able to use it for as long as I wanted (with the DVD)."
334396,-1.0,2018,Almost 3 months after purchasing it still have not been able to install Microsoft Office Home and Student 2016 because Microsoft claims that I need to install a firewall on my Mac first.  Did not see that one in the fine print.
334397,-1.0,2018,"Unfortunately, I bought the wrong product based on the recommendation of chatting online with another company. It doesnt work and I wasted my money."
334399,1.0,2018,Not quite sure why I had to wait to have a key delivered.  Would have been nice to be able to download the software immediately.
334400,1.0,2018,"I bought this because I could no longer use my 2008 version (in an ""update"", the entire WORD disappeared from my computer, and Microsoft could not find it when I enquired; also, it could no longer be downloaded nor activated with a key code - non-supported). So in a way I was ""forced"" to upgrade. I did NOT like the pressure to buy into Office 365, with its continual pay by the month charge. MS WORD is the industry standard, so what more can you say about the product? It is the sales method and pressure that I do not buy into, and my rating reflects that."
334401,1.0,2018,"No issues with installation.  It was a bit tricky as it needed me to sign in to finalize but kept linking me to my work's software account for some reason.  after cancelling the sign in, it started up and has worked as expected.  I was worried after reading the other reviews but didn't have any issues and I'm not overly computer savvy."

A pop up screen came up saying the keycode was corrected but there was a problem with installation and to call microsoft support and gave a telephone number.  That telephone number was a scammer who hacked into my new computer.  Have spent hours on the phone trying to solve problems and get my Apple account back.

Shame on MS for being so dictatorial."

334699,1.0,2018,Microsoft couldn't download this product after 3 hrs. on the phone. First they told me the product key was valid and next (2nd Level  )they said it wasn't..  Is your inventory comprised or is Microsoft wrong.  You need to investigate because your products from Microsoft may be compromised
334700,-1.0,2018,The product key code does not work.  I just unwrapped it today and tried to up load it and it didn't didnt work.  I had to buy another one directly from Microsoft.  I would like a refund.

334711,1.0,2018,works great
334712,1.0,2018,Why is it assumed that purchasers know how to use the software? Whatever happened to User's Guides? Office 2016 is way different from the older version that i am used to. Is there a downloadable owner's manual?
334713,1.0,2018,It does what I expect.
334717,-1.0,2018,Purchased this a few months ago - just got it set up and ready to use recently and it says the product key is invalid and I am using an unlicensed product.  Now I am out almost $100 and will have to purchase again?!!
334718,1.0,2018,Item as expected
334719,1.0,2018,"Was able to activate Microsoft Office 2016 Home & Student. Just a note to anyone having a problem with this Product Key, you must have a Microsoft account to use it.  First set up a Microsoft Account. Also, the software must be downloaded and installed first into your computer. The only function of a Product Key is to activate the software once it has been installed in your computer.

My computer came pre-installed with a trial version of Office 365, which is a subscription-based software.  As I did not want to pay every year for Office, I decided instead to get a permanent installation of Office 2016 Home & Student. Upon entering the Product Key number, I was prompted to activate Office 2016 Home & Student instead of Office 365, and this seems to have worked out fine.

Upon starting up Word or Excel, I see a brief ""Office 365"" logo on the screen, and then it opens Word 2016 or Excel 2016 instead.  Upon checking the actual version of the software (in Word or Excel go to File and then Account), I was informed that it is indeed Office 2016 Home & Student and not Office 365.

Hope this helps."

At reinstall, MS stated that the product key was bogus.  Moral 1: if it's working now, do not tinker with the installation it may be seen as pirated software afterward.  Moral 2: if it's priced at 2/3'rds the price from others, chances are there's something wrong.

He kept trying to convince me that the software could not be installed unless I paid the 199. Finally I just hung up. Logged into Microsoft and the product key worked fine.

334814,0.0,2018,I'm sure this program will be fine. I've used Microsoft Office as long as the program has been available. My problem is that I bought a new computer and the plan was to put newer versions of Word and Excel on it since that is what I use most. My old computer was full of information that I needed to take over to the new computer. I had been using an older version of Microsoft Office. Much to my surprise the new Office could not print or even open in many cases the existing work. I've done everything I know to do to fix the problem so to speak. It's seems now I will have to recreate the material I need to keep. Oh did I mention that I also have to retrain myself on the programs. They are quite different from the programs I've used for years. I will probably like the new program better it's just at this point in my life learning anything is more complicated.

336247,-1.0,2018,"I bought this product from Amazon.  It downloaded and installed correctly, but would not authorize for use.  After trying and trying to authorize through my Mac, I tried the telephone authorization option.  Microsoft stated this copy was a not a legitimate version.  When I called Amazon (after being on hold for considerable time, they refused to give a refund.  Instead, they transferred me to Microsoft.  Microsoft support stated this failure to authorize was a know issue that they were working on and that they would contact me when the issue was resolved.  They also stated that they would refund my money if I had bought it from them (Microsoft), but since I bought from Amazon it was Amazon's responsibility to offer any refund.  So, I can continue to use MS Office on my Mac for another 15 days as a trial, then I'm probably out-of-luck.  The moral of the story, don't buy this or any other software from Amazon!"
336248,-1.0,2018,"If you buy this product for your Mac, be prepared for spending time with the Microsoft support people.

There's apparently a bug in the current version of the software that makes the activation process not work.  Every 24 hours, when you start up one of the apps you'll get a dialog box that says ""You must activate your copy of Office for Mac within xx days."" (It starts at 15 days, and goes down each day.)  It doesn't matter if you press ""Activate Now"" or ""Activate Later"" -- the activation process is apparently broken.

I have had 3 calls with level 2 support, and the best they can do is run a license removal tool, and restart the activation process.  That resets the counter back to 15 days, but doesn't fix the problem.  The first two support people promised me that they had fixed the problem.  The third person was finally honest with me, and admitted that there's a bug in the software and that the fix won't be released until sometime in September.

A note to the ""Microsoft Customer Care"" person leaving responses on Amazon: you're not helping by giving out URLs with activation troubleshooting tips.  None of those tips will work.  If you really cared about your customers, you would tell your development team they need to release the fix for this bug NOW, not in a month!"

I'm past the temporary use period and now cannot use any of the programs I spent over a hundred bucks to purchase. There is no fix in sight and I'm basically stuck waiting for them to figure it out. The only help they offered was for me to download the office 365 and use that temporarily, not very helpful. I need Word and PowerPoint and don't want to spend more to purchase an earlier version, plus I'm pretty sure there's no option to return the instant download, so I'm essentially being held hostage by this crappy company.

Went to Microsoft site for support via chat. The issue wasn't resolved but the tech was very professional. I was scheduled today for another shot by a Microsoft tech; I am not optimistic.

336317,-1.0,2018,"*Update: 9 days later* Did an experiment and bought another license key from a physical retailer (Best Buy). Removed the license and software I got through Amazon, activated the new license, and installed (through the same Microsoft account I set up). After installing the programs, I found that the new product from Best Buy gave me the EXACT same installation ID as the license key I bought through Amazon. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both of my license packages a few times to be sure this was the case. I'm not sure if the ""non-legitimate"" ID is associated with my computer, or my online account with Microsoft that stores my licenses, or if it's actually just THE installation ID for the product itself--for all of its 2016 single download products for Mac. However, this is clearly a Microsoft issue, and not a retailer issue (I don't expect either retailer can refund me--maybe there's a way I can get Microsoft to issue a refund if their services continue not to work? I doubt it...). I figured out after a few visits to the Microsoft support website how to get the chat feature to let me chat with a live person. Gave the live person permission to see and control my desktop for the length of our chat session. Support specialist hit my ""activate later"" button on my side of the screen in one of my programs and claimed to have input the necessary activation key (I presume/hope that, on his screen that I couldn't see, he typed what goes into those boxes that show up the first time you install the software and it prompts you to activate by phone like he said he did when I asked him why he hit ""activate later"" on my side). Specialist claimed my product was now activated. BUT, my Office products have continued to prompt me every single day since the specialist ""activated"" it to activate the product or have the features deactivate in a given diminishing amount of time.

When I asked the specialist why I would have the same installation ID for a product I bought from two different stores, and why it says it's not legitimate, he said this is a common issue and that it has something to do with Microsoft servers not working properly for download sometimes.

On the bright side, before figuring out how to chat with a live specialist, I discovered that one can reboot the 15-day trial period by removing the license and uninstalling the software, then downloading and reinstalling everything. I suppose I could do that every 10-15 days to keep my products working...but it would be nice to just have them work.

----------

Just purchased this a few days ago for my new MacBook Pro, and can't get the product to activate. I wish I'd purchased this directly from Microsoft instead of through Amazon (I was trying to save myself $10, and may end up having to spend another $150 to get it from the source)--I called to activate (multiple times in case I was just typing the installation ID in wrong), and got the message that Microsoft does not recognize the ID as legitimate. I've been following the links posted by Admins to the other one star reviews to try troubleshooting the installation--de-installing and re-installing, running the activation troubleshooter script, de-installing the licensing, rebooting, and trying to activate again after installing. Before de-installing and re-installing the license specifically, I followed steps on the support website and ran the Activation Troubleshooting script. This allowed me to get to a point where the ""Activate by Phone"" screen was no longer showing up every time I opened the programs, but each day I still got a warning to activate the software within a diminishing length of time without a button even appearing in the program startup that I could click on for activation. I'm afraid this software is never going to activate and the trial period will run out. Don't buy it here--buy it from the source. I'm not sure what's going on, but Microsoft isn't recognizing the Amazon product as legit."

I just purchased this today--the download version for one PC. The whole process worked perfectly. I had no issues whatsoever purchasing it, downloading it, and installing it; and I'm not a computer wiz by any means.  During the purchase process, you do have to create a Microsoft account but that was also easy to do.

This suite includes Word, Power Point, Excel, and OneNote 2016.  I bought this mainly for ""Word"" because my very old--year 2000--version stopped working.  I did uninstall the 2000 version before downloading this new one.  My documents open up with no problems in this 2016 program; and even though my previous program was 16 years old, it's not real difficult figuring out how to perform certain functions in the new program (font changes, search, etc.).  Yes--it's not cheap, and I was debating this versus some free or less expensive suites/word processing programs, but I'm very happy with this purchase."

The worst thing: when you try to drag a window, it won't move smoothly like normal windows, it will accelerate then freeze, then move some more, and wind up in some random position on the screen where you hadn't wanted it.

I waited 4 1/2 hours for my phone call and finally got to talk to someone after I called them.  This tech again took over my computer and declared it activated.  He had done the exact same thing that the other had done.  The activation messages goes away but in 24 hours reappears again saying I have X number of days to activate this product.

This doesn't make the programs unusable but it is frustrating that it takes longer to get things done than it should."
336593,-1.0,2018,"An update on the negative review below.  My opinion still stands, but over an arduous period spent with Microsoft's terrible tech support system, I have learned of issues with this product.

The version of Office for Mac I purchased was 16.15,  When you purchase through Amazon, you are routed to the Microsoft site to upload and install the latest version.

The upshot of my issues is that I was finally found out there is a flaw in this version (after many live chats, many phone calls, and working with two Tier One tech support people, a series of promised return calls from Tier Two that NEVER came and my own persistence in finally, after 28 HOURS, reaching someone who could analyze and solve the problem).

Both Powerpoint and Word were having problems recognizing fonts-- frequently-used, system fonts like Helvetica and Gill.  I don't know if there are other problems, but this was, for my work, a real issue.

The upshot is that I was told there is a ""bug"" in versions after 15.41.  The tech support person tried installing 16.13 and something after 16.15 and the issue recurred.

So, do NOT buy and install this newer version!  The tech support person recommended that I NOT update when the message box pops up, ""until two months after it comes out.""  During the long waits for assorted versions to update, she checked with ""engineering"" to give me the information about the problem, so someone at Microsoft knows this is a recurring problem.  But they keep selling it.

I don't know what the solution is if you, like I, have to have an updated version compatible with an updated OS, other than aggressively pursuing a tech support person who actually knows what they are doing.

Microsoft tech support is really about the worst I have experienced-- they make it difficult to even find an option to use a live chat or a phone call with a real person.  I was constantly routed to the robot that analyzes your message and refers you to irrelevant articles before I eventually found the option to Live Chat and phone (which requires literally hours on hold and the broken promise of return calls).

The Tier One person who tried fixing the issue actually made it worse!

So, good luck and if you have an older version that still works, do NOT update or upgrade until you find out the later edition has been fixed!!!!

.......

My original review follows:

I hate everything Microsoft makes.  I am a Mac user, and MS-based PCs are horrible to use.  Everything Microsoft touches is far too complicated, takes too many steps, and, in the case of Word, Powerpoint and Excel, makes FAR too many decisions independently of the user, regardless of that user's desire or intent.  One must constantly undo actions that are automatic.  Unfortunately, in the case of Office, it is more or less a monopoly.  So, once again, with a new computer, I bought a new version of Office for Mac (unlike in the past, the computer store would not simply copy the older version that I OWN onto the new machine, although they were willing and able to do this with other applications).

I have been through 4 versions in the past years, each more unnecessarily complicated than the last, and with all the options relocated on any given window so it is never easy to figure out where to find each tool.  Adobe, Filemaker, Freeway and the programs that come already installed on a Mac are all fairly quick and easy and, once one knows the basics, user-friendly.

Microsoft is a nightmare.

I purchased this through Amazon, because it was slightly cheaper than through the Microsoft website, and at these prices, every little bit helps.

The Amazon end was fairly straightforward.  The email gave clear instructions as to where on the Amazon account page to find the purchase, and a clear working link that takes one to the Microsoft website.  That's where the problems begin.  In my case TWO HOURS of problems, that required navigating endless windows that open with each instruction followed, as well as a first attempt with MS's automated ""Help"" feature, which is essentially useless.  None of the instructions work.  I was constantly being directed to a ""download"" option on my account home page.  The problem?  That option or a link to it were non-existent.

I finally went to the Live Chat option, and ultimately had to enable a remote access for the MS representative.  He/she went to a download option through a route that was in no way related to the instructions I had been given.  Ultimately, this process took TWO HOURS from purchase to a working version of the software, which is about an hour and 40 minutes longer than the Adobe Creative Suite took.  This included a long wait while each of the applications was updated.

The rep told me I should have bought through the MS website to avoid that.  I am not sure exactly why this is.  Is it because MS just wants to control all purchases, in which case why allow it to be sold through Amazon?  And why charge more through the MS website?  Is it that Amazon is only allowed to sell an older version which then must be updated in order to work?  That should be specified.  But what I bought is called ""Office 2016,"" which is the latest version, so why should it even need to be updated to work in even the most basic way?

Overall, Microsoft has been allowed for years to position itself as a monopoly despite inferior products (shades of VHS vs. Betamax).  So one has little choice but to use Office.  Just brace yourself when you buy it for a long installation process and the endless glitches inflicted on the user."
336594,1.0,2018,"I don't like to leave reviews, but I was feeling very conflicted about buying this after reviewing the product both on Amazon and on Microsoft's own website. As it turns out, downloading was a breeze, the instructions were clear, and it was up and running within 15 minutes. Furthermore, I was easily able to transfer files from my old Mac with an ancient copy of office suite to this version on my new Mac with a flash drive. I used the download rather than the key. If you need office Microsoft Office, this is the way to go."
336595,1.0,2018,"Based on many poor reviews of this product, I was very reluctant to buy this software to replace my Office 2008 for Mac.  However, my Macbook Pro (2016 model) was really starting to complain about the antique software I was using, and it was not performing well.  So I reluctantly took the plunge and downloaded the software.

So far, I have had very few problems with Office 2016 for Mac.  Some dates reformatted in Excel, and that was annoying, but overall my old files open and perform fine in the new software.  Also, I did not have to delete the Office 2008 for Mac the way some people have, which turned out to be a good thing when dates reformatted and I needed to check what the actual dates had been.  I just opened the affected spreadsheet in Office 2008 and copied over the dates as values into the same spreadsheet when open in Office 2008.

I am relieved the software works as intended on my laptop -- and feel bad for the many people for whom it has not performed.  But in my case, at least, it was a good upgrade and a reasonable experience with few issues."

336597,1.0,2018,"I read numerous reviews about the online download being problematic. I was hesitant to purchase it but I went ahead anyway. I had no problems downloading the software. However, it took about an hour to download it on my brand new, fully charged MacBook Pro. This is the same Microsoft we all know, so no surprises there. I just wish it hadn't taken so long to download. Otherwise, no issues with the digital download on safari."
336598,1.0,2018,"I love MS Office for Mac Home & Student. The only think I don't like about it is they don't have a version with Outlook, since that is the email system my university uses."

336607,1.0,2018,"AMAZON-Download was seamless, and fast, no problems.  In minutes I started using the software. Amazon did have the best price of all the reputable places I compared.
MICROSOFT-I've used ""Office"" in the past, at my job.  Personally, I've not needed it, ""Open Office"" software has met ALL my personal and home business needs, for about 15 years, and it's FREE!
But now, due to a lot of interaction with other users of ""Word"", it's just simpler to have it myself, so I broke down and bought it.  Sometimes the margins got a little tweaked changing from an ""Office"" document, to my ""Open Office"" software, and back again.

336645,1.0,2018,Great price. Very useful product
336646,1.0,2018,"I had trouble getting this downloaded and operational on a new 2017 Macbook.  But it's accomplished now.  First I contacted Microsoft and asked if it would download with Duck Duck Go.  An enthusiastic but very naive person assured me they do this with Safari all the time!  Before the download really began, it hung up because it couldn't determine what state I was in, and did not have a window for me to indicate the state.  So I downloaded Chrome, and tried again.  On archaic rural DSL, the download took almost two hours using an ethernet cable.  The download showed only about 17 MB for the whole program, which was worrying until it completed, and the download was over 1GB.  Then I had to call up Microsoft and give them the long identifying number for my program, but they had no record of it and didn't recognize it, so my program remained unusable.  I did this several times in case I had made an error.  I did it verbally, and then by punching in the numbers with my phone.  It's a little hard to get a real person at Microsoft, and when you get one, they're friendly, eager to help, and apparently don't have a clue.  I refused their offer to take over my laptop remotely.  After I ran out of time, they arranged to phone me the next day, and phoned right on schedule.

I re-read Amazon's instructions.  It said if you had it downloaded and it wasn't operating right, to delete it, empty the trash, and try again.  I almost did that.  Then I removed any and all restrictions against websites and cookies, etc., in Safari and used Google.  I clicked on the registration window again, phoned up again, read the long chain of numbers again, and was denied again.  I clicked on the Word icon, got a notice it needed an update, which I did, and IT WORKED.  Very mysterious, but welcome.  After playing with all four programs and saving and opening a few files, I got a little warning window from Word, saying it was unable to load Visual Basic for Applications.  I had not yet cancelled my phone appointment with Microsoft tech, so when they called, I asked about it.  They said it was for Windows, not Mac, and if it came up again, take a screen shot and contact them.

So after hours and hours, by the second day, I was able to use the program, and so far I like it very much.  It's a little more basic than my old MS Office from pre-2010, but it has a nice clean look and is easy to use.  You can save files to the cloud or your computer.  I don't know what the install problem is, but you'd think they'd put some effort into making it, well, effortless.  I'm not the only one who had trouble downloading it.

I'm grateful to all the reviewers; being forewarned, I didn't let it phase me, and set aside a lot of time for it.  I have no idea why the install is so difficult.  I originated the install from Amazon, which throws you right to Microsoft, but you don't have to enter your key code that way.  If I'd deleted everything and started over, I'd go straight to Microsoft and type in the key code Amazon gives you.  It might work better.  Or not.  It's what Amazon recommends doing on your second try.

Good luck."
336647,0.0,2018,"Unfortunately Microsoft offers the standalone version of Office in a crippled form compared to the more expensive subscription version 365.

In this case specifically, customizing toolbars is not in the standalone version even though it was in the 2011 version.  So, if you created toolbars for the kids to streamline their use of Office, all that is blown away and they now have to navigate the huge, bloated, and dense default ribbons, etc.

Also, dictation does not work in Excel and if you use it in Word, the program will hang.

All in all, not worth the headache for home users."
336648,1.0,2018,Quick and easy download. Couldnt ask for a better deal.
336650,-1.0,2018,This was the worst purchase of my entire lifetime. I spent over four hours with two separate Microsoft technicians finally getting Office for the Mac 2016 installed. I am a Zen Master nerd -- So.....the fault is with Microsoft's horrible security and download system. If Microsoft reads this; they need to improve their system for downloading !!!!!
336651,-1.0,2018,"It's all been downhill for MS Office on the Mac since 2011.  Publishing layout view on Word...gone, lots of stability issues and poor PDF support in Word. And Excel is still slow.  Part of me thinks Microsoft purposely cripples Office on the Mac so they'll sell more Windows machines.  Apple's iWork suite and Google Docs also have their limitations, so sadly Macs can't be the productivity machines they deserve to be."
336662,1.0,2018,Convenient
336663,1.0,2018,Fast Fun and Friendly!!
336664,-1.0,2018,Useless.  Key provided did not work.
336665,-1.0,2018,"After a long while, I wasn't able to download the second license and when I called Microsoft, they tried to charge me a fee to troubleshoot my computer and refused to give me a credit."
336666,-1.0,2018,And trying to get any technical support from either Amazon or Microsft is proving to be impossible. what happened to the days where you download from a cd and the program works just fine? Not worth the money due to the amount of time needed to 'fix' it.
336667,1.0,2018,"The key card reviews made me nervous so we bought this and it worked great. We have windows 10, and it was a very simple download. It probably took less than 5 minutes. I don't know too much about the new look, but it reminds me a lot of Google Docs, which is free. I only bought this because most workplace computers use office and its a comparability thing."
336668,-1.0,2018,"People, please save your money and do NOT buy this product.  The program will not download.  Microsoft is no help to get it downloaded.  Don't go through the hassle of getting a refund.  DO NOT BUY THIS!  You have been warned!  My wife purchased this product twice and could not get it downloaded.  I purchased this product too for a new computer and I had the same problem!  Your only option is to get a refund if Amazon will give it.  I'm working on my refund now!

UPDATE:  I tried to download this program numerous times and gave up.  I started one more download effort and left my home for 3 hours.  When I returned, the program was installed but it took about 3 hours!  No refund for me because I need Office 2016 on a Windows 10 computer.  I still would not recommend this product.  We wasted a total of 6 hours over two days trying to get this thing downloaded.  It's time to use disks again to install programs. Long and complex downloads are not fair to the consumers of these products."
336669,-1.0,2018,"The software is absolute garbage. Graphing makes you want to throw a chair out of a window, worst experience I've had with computer software."
336670,-1.0,2018,"The download process, even if you follow the instructions to the letter will not work.  You will be forced to open a Microsoft Outlook account, then someone from Microsoft's Customer Support will try and help but ever if you follow their instructions to the letter, it will not install.  Next you will have to sign a waiver and download Microsoft Software that will enable their Customer Support to install the software on your computer.  It even took her a while but she got it done.  I said afterwards to rescind the Contract / Waiver I had to sign granting them god knows what (like I'm a lawyer that had the time to read it) and to uninstall the software she installed allowing her to remotely access my computer.  She said the Contract was for a single purpose only so no need to rescind (have to take her word as I don't get a copy) and then she deleted the software from my Download History which anyone knows doesn't delete the application from my machine.  I've bought and installed software before.  Never had this much trouble or had to give up so much privacy to get the software installed.  Not even close."
336671,1.0,2018,"Easy to download, install and use immediately."
336673,1.0,2018,Amazing program!
336674,-1.0,2018,I downloaded from my software library and it's saying the product key isn't valid. Not happy.
336676,-1.0,2018,"I would give it NO stars if I could. Buggy software cost me 8 paid client hours of tech support, FIVE of which were waiting on hold and they still could not fix the issue. That's right, folks - it took me EIGHT HOURS to be told that they are aware of the software issue and they are working on it. That would have helped 7.5 hours ago......

Never again."
336677,-1.0,2018,Terrible installation process.  Still not activated 8 hours later.  DO NOT BUY this way unless you want lots of extra work to install the product.
336678,1.0,2018,Works great with my daughters new Apple MacBook Air.
336679,-1.0,2018,It doesn't work. Waste of time. I want a refund.
336680,1.0,2018,Needed Excel and Word to use with new computer and existing files. Got Excel and Word. Setup is straightforward and relatively simple.
336681,1.0,2018,"I was wary from all the bad reviews for this, but glad I just went with it anyway. It is super easy to install. You just have to create a Microsoft account and download the software directly from Microsoft. Not a big deal and I got up and running in >20 min. No issues whatsoever and it saved me a trip to the store."
336692,1.0,2018,"If you're like me and love the ease of use of an Apple product, but despise their software offerings, this is a great addition to your Mac. For work or play you can't go wrong with the MS Office suite. Very easy to install, no problems!"
336693,-1.0,2018,"I wanted a simple home accounting system.
so far I don't think that Office is going to do that for me but I must give it some some more use to know for sure."
336694,1.0,2018,Hay it's Office.  What else needs to be said
336695,-1.0,2018,"Full of bugs. Piece of crap. Had to get a legitimate version from a Microsoft store. Will never buy software like this ever again. Best to buy software from a Microsoft brick and mortar store. That way there's a person to help if there is a problem. If for a laptop, can even have them install it for you and work out any problems on the spot."
336696,1.0,2018,Just what I needed. Easy download and familiar functionality and look.
336697,1.0,2018,Great Seller and Great Item
336698,-1.0,2018,"I bought this to upgrade from Office 2011 for Mac.  I had to upgrade because Microsoft stopped supporting Office 2011, and Word started displaying some fonts improperly, making the documents look bad.

When I installed Office 2016, the new Word began stretching the line spacing, causing all old documents to repaginate.  An 8-page document done in Word 2011 would run to 11 pages in Word 2016.  It's completely unusable for my office.

After I spent almost two hours on help chat with Microsoft, the tech finally had to admit that she couldn't help me.

Now, I find that the purchase was nonreturnable and nonrefundable.  I""m totally hosed."
336699,-1.0,2018,"It downloaded just fine to my Mac, although it took hours, and then needed hours of updates. But has there even been a worse program created than Microsoft Office? I've used it for three days and it has already crashed about 10 times. I forgot what it was like to lose work. Can we all please agree never to use this program again? I only use it because others insist on it."
336701,1.0,2018,Easy to use
336702,1.0,2018,"This is the legitimate English language version of the product, and is the easiest way to get and install 2016 Home and Student that there is, and it is a one time fee rather than recurring payments. It is a single user license for Word, Excel and Powerpoint.

To ensure safety in the event of emergency (i.e. hard drive failure or other critical computer failure) simply copy or write down the license key from your Amazon software library (which not even be necessary if Amazon keeps that information for you indefinitely) and bookmark the Microsoft installation page which tells you that it can be used for re-installation. It also optionally integrates with Dropbox for fail safe off site storage of your documents, if desired.

The process went quickly and flawlessly. I was up and running with the 3 products in less than 5 minutes (100mbps broadband connection). Highly recommended for those looking for a quick and legitimate installation of these 3 Microsoft apps."
336703,-1.0,2018,Unable to activate.  The download indicated it was completed and ready to use.  However I cannot activate it.  Unable to get response from online resource for live chat or call.  Very disappointed.

336711,-1.0,2018,Would not download on my computer!! States product key is invalid.  Do not purchase. I can't even get a refund.
336722,-1.0,2018,Took more than 2 hours with Microsoft tech support to activate the account after the software was installed. Ridiculous! I bought MS Office to save time learning the Mac office suite. I could have spent the 2 hours learning Mac office suite and saved myself the $.
336723,1.0,2018,Works excellent with MacBook ~ a little cumbersome to download since I purchased it while out of the USA but easy enough to figure out. Just use a VPN and it downloads with ease.
336724,1.0,2018,Easy to purchase and install.
336726,-1.0,2018,"Still struggles with minor compatibility issues. I thought with buying the full version that I wouldn't have to worry about a software updater. However, Microsoft slips in an Office 365 updater which runs in the background, even though I decline to setup the Onedrive sync. Since they're in the business of supplying regular updates, why doesn't Microsoft work on the mail merge issue in the Mac version?
Thinking about buying? Just get the one month version from Microsoft for $6.99 and then cancel if you do not like it. This way you will not be out the full $129 it costs for this non-refundable version."
336727,1.0,2018,Had problems with what was the code from amazon and what was the code from Microsoft. too many codes.
336728,-1.0,2018,"Lacks some features (like ""Focus view"" or whatever it's called) that my prior version had. Leave it to Microsoft to simultaneously make bloatware AND leave out previous, and useful features."
336729,1.0,2018,Office is the industry standard.
336730,1.0,2018,Very good programs.
336731,-1.0,2018,If you go to college you can sign up with Microsoft and get the package free . I bought the Microsoft office download and could not return.
336732,1.0,2018,Good deal!
336733,-1.0,2018,"I don't know who is the genius behind MS' move to single PC/user in Office Home&Student 2013/2016, as opposed to the 3 PCs/users ""Family Pack"" that we had for the 2007 and 2010 versions. Oh, is this supposed to push us towards a hundred dollar yearly subscription? Well, guess what, not only MS's Office suite gets worse with each new version, free office suites get better every month! So much improvement in so short periods of time, they have been good enough since a couple of years or more. I've been testing LibreOffice5 since I upgraded my home PCs to Windows 10, not going back to this steal.
So long, MS Office!
R.I.P."
336734,1.0,2018,I downloaded Microsoft Office 2016 it was so easy to do it!
336735,1.0,2018,Seamless digital download from amazon.
336737,-1.0,2018,"Can't download it.  Didn't get email with code necessary to activate a Microsoft account.  On the Microsoft site could not find answer to the problem.  I finally saw a link that said I could talk to someone.  Before I could get to them I was informed that I had to have a Microsoft account before proceeding.  Couldn't get Microsoft account because I didn't have the code from the email I didn't receive.  Sound like you heard this before.  Downloading software seems to have too many processes that need to occur exactly as planned to be successful.  At least there should be unrestricted access to someone who help with the problem.  Microsoft, I am disappointed..."
336739,1.0,2018,Able to dowload and use immediatly.
336740,1.0,2018,"Just what I needed. Very easy to download, just follow the instructions and use your common sense. The price is right and it's not a subscription."
336741,-1.0,2018,I hate Microsoft they haven't written anything good in 10 years but unfortunately in a business environment people are used to using Excel and Word.
336742,1.0,2018,Easy download.  Just follow the directions.
336743,1.0,2018,Just what I needed.

336747,1.0,2018,"It works well, still trying to get used to the differences."
336748,1.0,2018,Excellent for writers and was recommended to me by a mentor.
336749,-1.0,2018,It doesn't work. I try to use the product and a message (no message number and unable to copy) that the account number tamead2010@gmail.com isn't associated with the Office product. Try to 'activate' the product and get; the same message. Need a 'product key' I guess but ordering online doesn't give me one.
336750,1.0,2018,This's a good item with reasonable price.
336751,1.0,2018,I purchased this from Amazon and downloaded it. So far so good.
336762,-1.0,2018,"Terrible program! Not compatible with the most current High Sierra OS on Mac. Don't buy this! Use the Pages program that comes with your Mac, or use Numbers for your Excel needs. I'll never use MS Office again."
336763,-1.0,2018,it did not download excel
336764,1.0,2018,Easy install.  Downloaded quickly with no issues whatsoever. It works perfectly on my new MacBook Pro.
336765,-1.0,2018,"Terrible product.  Constantly buggy, breaking my presentations and no way to recover my work.  Idiotic GUI where it's impossible to find anything you are looking for and constantly having to Google where to find particular features.  I don't know how PowerPoint became an industry standard because it has never been good.  I have used it for years (because I had to for work and school) and dear lord I HATE POWERPOINT.  Please someone make a better product so we can finally put PowerPoint in it's grave.  Other products in Office like Excel are pretty bad as well but I have a particular vendetta against PowerPoint."
336766,1.0,2018,Works exactly as I expect and the cloud feature makes using this product easier than ever! Now I can actually use my Mac on the go like I intended.
336767,1.0,2018,Downloaded and installed easily and has worked fine.
336768,1.0,2018,Just what I wanted
336769,1.0,2018,It works and is useful to me.
336770,0.0,2018,It's Okay
336771,-1.0,2018,It won't download for me.  Even when I use the key code nothing happens.  I want my money back!!!
336772,-1.0,2018,Was buying this software for a different computer and would not load because the e-mail attached to the computer didn't match that of the purchaser.  This has become way too complicated.

336776,-1.0,2018,Was unable to download this software... no way to return it... and I had to purchase from Moicrosoft store which worked perfectly.

work and registered as expected!"
336780,-1.0,2018,"I bought this to put on my daughters computer.  Instructions were not helpful and when asked to enter Microsoft login, I entered my own and I already have office, so it would not let me enter the product key on my daughters computer, even after we created a Microsoft login for her."
336781,1.0,2018,Fast and easy but there was some error in Word. It roule even open.
336782,-1.0,2018,Horrible.  I am more and more frustrated every time I have to deal with Microsoft.  They change the user interface for no good reason other than what I can see as justifying charging people more money.  This product is slow and horrible.  Wish I stayed on Office 2007.
336783,0.0,2018,"I was forced to buy this because MS no longer supports their products beyond 10 years. This version is not an update in the literal sense because it is inferior to the older one. It messed up many of my files, and it continues to ask stupid questions when I want to save a file or call one up. But, what can one do? Microsoft has a monopoly on their products, and they no longer will give you a disk. They want to do everything on line so that they can take over your computer. The MS rep was very arrogant in insisting that this method of installation was superior to a disk. Nonsense! Without help from a caring Amazon rep, I may never have been able to install the software. The MS rep said that it was easy, and implied that their instructions could be followed by a dummy. Again, not true. It took this arrogant #$%#@% an hour to install it. Lord help me if my computer crashes as I do not want to go through this again"
336784,1.0,2018,The product is working well as expected.
336787,1.0,2018,"It's Office, not much to say.  Didn't want to be tied to a subscription so this was a good option, plus I don't need the extra programs that come with 365.  This will get you the basics that any business/student will need."
336789,1.0,2018,Very good product. Easy to install and begin using
336790,1.0,2018,As advertised

336803,1.0,2018,"I was slightly hesitant due to some negative reviews for this product, but went ahead based on the good ones! It was quick to purchase and installed in under 15 mins with no issues at all!"
336804,1.0,2018,"I was on my son's 365 Home subscription but got tired of being under his account and it was about to end. This is the better version especially for Mac, it's a one time purchase and no subscription nonsense. This can even be transferred to another Mac! Monthly updates are also nice to keep everything working as it should."
336805,-1.0,2018,Buy this for an Apple computer because it will not work on any other Apple device.
336806,0.0,2018,"Install was a problem; ended up having to call Microsoft for advice. Advice was clear all cookies then try reload. I dislike the pausing that is happening when I scroll through dense Excel files, even though I have ""store in the cloud"" option turned off. I purchased 2016 version because my previous version was no longer supported by latest Mac update. I seriously considered the learning curve of Pages / Numbers and/or Open Office versus 'same old Microsoft Office'. Chose Microsoft Office for efficiency of my time."

So far everything is working well and is updated more from Microsoft Office 2010 and 2013 that I am accustomed to. Works well, but the software is expensive of course."
336824,-1.0,2018,This is not what I wanted and will not pay for it. I wanted the disk to go with the desktop I purchased
336825,1.0,2018,"As Stephan G said in his review, follow some procedures and download from your games and software library after purchase.  Amazon also prompts you to that location.

I'd been using third-party freeware for years until I had to go back to college (my college does not have an agreement with Microsoft so I had to purchase my own).  I wanted to use Grammarly to interface with it and that software only works with Office.  No regrets.  I still use open-source on the other machine (old habits and all) but this is also what we use at work, so at least I'm familiar with it."
336879,1.0,2018,the best
336880,-1.0,2018,Has never loaded. Deleted and retried but will not load and run. Do not buy it! There is no one to caelpor ask for . Why are they allowing this to be sold with no way to contact anyone?

336902,-1.0,2018,"One-note (NOT OUTLOOK).  Spent $150 for what I expected was Outlook (#1), excel, and word,.  Supposed to have a refund/discount for spending $2000 on a surface with office combo.

Awful product and awful experience with Amazon, Microsoft, and everyone involved."

336905,1.0,2018,"Very easy to download. I cannot understand why people cannot make a Microsoft account, literally takes 5 minutes and complain about how slow it takes to download. Once you purchase the code, it takes 5 minutes to verify in your orders tab on Amazon. Then after it is down saying ""purchase verifying,"" you press ""Go to Your Software Library."" After you press it, press the ""Go to Office.com"" and it will ask you to make an account if you do not have one. If you do have an account, you just need to verify your info and it will automatically download after all that. This saved me about $19, better than paying $150 from the website or the store. Highly recommend buying this if you're trying to save money and want it instantly."

I connected an external hard drive to my MAC laptop.  I have had Word 2008 since, well, 2008.  I'm a writer and it was more than enough for me.  I didn't need to be better since I've written 500 page disertations and novels with it with extremely complicated formatting and it's worked fine..

I always worried updating Mac OSX would make it stop working as microsoft doesn't guarantee updates for older versions of office on new platforms

SO, i updated my current computer with most uptodate OS and Word 2008 still worked fine.  BUT I connected an external harddrive with a backed-up version of a different computer of mine.  I was trying to transfer files directly, so I didn't use google drive or whatever.  It wouldn't let transfer the files at all  because it said the two platforms were different (even though I had literally done the same thing two days earlier before I updated the platform.)  BUT while it would let me copy files, it NONETHELESS installed software on my computer I didn't permit it to do.  I was in a separate user account precisely for this purpose, the the external hard drive installed it across the whole computer.  (Passport hard drive).

HOW is this related to microsoft?  It is.  One of the things connecting the harddrive to my MAC did in new platfortm?  It REMOVED Word 2008 completely and 'replaced' it with Word 2011 (which of course didn't work because I never bought it but when I tried to open it it routed me to microsoft to buy it.)  SO microsoft has some deal with the hardware maker -- Passport sold  at Best Buy -- to do this.  It also installed a bunch of weird programs I had to remove manuallyl and who knows what I don't know about?

BUt what is most enraging is that it literally deleted a program that was mine, I paid for, I owned with no permission whatsover.  SO as we all know, microsoft sucks, but still.

Anyway, I buy Office 2016 so I won't have to bother buying another word processor for a decade.  I'm still getting used to it, but already it has crashed THREE times in maybe 3 days.  If they call that an improvement that warrents my giving them more money, well, screw that.  I have already identified something really stupid that makes it crash: when you are in spell check the text in the window is too small, so i did Control-+ to see if I could make the text bigger.  How does Word respond?  It crashes.  Really.  If you have it try it out.

BUT there is a second thjing microsoft did when I actually did install word 2016.  this makes no sense.  It activated Icloud -- a mac product -- again without my permission and had it save whatever it could from my laptop in the cloud.  I've always had macs and never used icloud even though it is there.  It emerged and activated in the menu bar at time BUT I only realized it was saving stuff when I searched for a file of my computer through the finder and it showed two of it because one was in iCloud

I know it makes not sense but it happened and they did it.  Microsoft has it's own cloud service i think but who knows why or how?

Lastly, I save my files online through Google Docs.  Microsoft makes it almost impossible to save files to Google drive.  This is also in violation of anti-trust laws -- companies are not allowed to force you or even compel you to use their other products but making it impossible to use those of their competitors.  Office has a system to set up all the cloud and other connections and NONE of them are competitor companies -- ALL owned by Microsoft.  When you search for competitor product packages, APPS, whatever they don't exist.  They even make it seem these products don't exist and try to fool you into using other software with similar names

Bleh. Yuck.  Microsoft leaves a terrible taste in my mouth

If a new word processor crashes doing the same thing the old processor did fine, well, something is wrong ...."

336936,1.0,2018,"From what I have experienced so far this is a more than adequate suite of applications for my needs.
I do have to say that the Excel Spreadsheet is different from those I have used before and it is a bit of a challenge to learn to use it.
Also, again related to the Spreadsheet, if I use any color panels within the work, when they are sent to older versions of Excel the colors change, in
some cases dramatically.  I have no idea why this is, but it is."

I clicked download, then run and voila, literally 5 minutes later everything was set up. I couldn't believe it!

338635,0.0,2018,"So after using this security software for the past several months, I have come to experiencing what some people have complained about.
Okay, so the cons are:
- Popup promotions of additional services such as Lifelock, and other addons
- Some of these popups by Norton / Semantic cannot be disabled, and therefore, it continues to be annoying like once a week.
- Sometimes the popups doesnt display correctly and there is no simple way of getting rid of it, therefore, it gets in the way of what you are doing on the computer.
- If you are a developer and you have a binary application that utilizes the internet, the security tends to find some way to block the application. That is good, but admin with control of settings, I should be able to add this to exceptions but even after I do, it still gives me problems.
I am coming from using Kaspersky, and by far, still Kaspersky is the best experience I have had. It sucks, its I have to risk privacy potentially just to have less annoying security!?
The Pros are:
- It detects malware outside of zipped containers. (Shouldnt that be a con? I haven't notice it detecting malware within zip / tar / iso, etc.)
- Stays up to date
Anyways, sorry, but even though I was trying to get away from Kaspersky, I also did not want to go to Norton because of my past experience with using it. But if I was able to disable some of the con features included in this Norton suite, then I would say that it is as good as Kaspersky. So if you are looking for a security suite for you computer(s), please keep in mind of these cons before buying. If you think unwanted promotional popups regularly is not annoying to you, then this is the security suite for you. You will still be protected by a good detection system, and that is the important part."

I can't even contact the seller because there seems to be no option for that through the product page.  If this doesn't work by tomorrow, I'll be requesting my money back.  Of course, if it works, I'd be happy to update my rating to 3 stars because it's a decent product, but not being available immediate and no direct access for support from the seller (through the product page) is a big disappointment."
338721,1.0,2018,Much cheaper here ...just download...better than just basic nortons.
338722,1.0,2018,Very good security
338726,1.0,2018,"You can't go wrong with Norton, I renew it every year.  Good price at Amazon."
338727,1.0,2018,good product
338729,1.0,2018,"Good virus and internet security. I did a lot of investigation before deciding on this brand and I was nervous when I got the software because we've had some bad luck. I needed something easy to use - it was going on my husband's computer, not mine, and he doesn't like to mess with it. I needed it to mostly run itself. I needed it to be good, to not be slow, to not be too expensive, to have a nice interface on his screen, and to only have to be checked by me once every week or two. This product satisfied all those requirements."
338732,-1.0,2018,"cant download to my PC will have to cancel; order!!!  need to return!!!!!! or send me the disk so I can install it myself, cant do the download"
338733,1.0,2018,"The product is great (have been using for many years), never found any problems w/ it, just works & don't ever need to call their tech support for anything.  I downloaded it & later installed it after my current version had expired.  No complaints, also works well in my Firefox browser w/ the Identity Safe plugin feature - I find this feature very useful !"
338734,1.0,2018,I am very happy with this product. If the prices are reasonable I would buy this again. I would highly recommend this product.
338735,1.0,2018,Norton always works great for me. Received my download code instantly and my pc has been running much better ever since!

338741,1.0,2018,"Very satisfied as always with Norton. Been using Norton products since 2003 and they have never let any malware get through and kept my PC humming ever since. Well worth the money. Avoid the free stuff. In PC security, you get what you pay for..."

338758,1.0,2018,First time using Norton - years of using McAfee and happy I made the change.
338759,-1.0,2018,Only one of my devices has downloaded the product. The others won't take the key because of a previous expired subscription. Wasted hours of my time and is still not working. ugh

338761,1.0,2018,I've had Norton Security for going on 3 year now and I've been happy with it. I bought this as a renewal for 2018
338762,-1.0,2018,"The product advertising is completely false.  Norton does not work with iOS products, it will not allow you to download or activate.  When I contacted their customer service this is the response I got: ""Scan/AntiVirus feature is not compatible with iOS devices....""

I was astonished since the first sentence of Norton's product description is ""Norton Security Deluxe secures up to 5 PCs, Macs, iOS & Android devices...."""
338763,-1.0,2018,"Can i have a refund please? This is so unfair, it says that it's not valid in my region (New Zealand) so im sat here with a product that doesn't work."

338765,1.0,2018,I am a loyal Norton user for 35 years. The protection has never let me down. I continue to actively endorse to all who ask.

338777,1.0,2018,arrived on time was as advertized
338779,-1.0,2018,"I work in technology and have been using Symantec/Norton for over a decade. I have found the product to be mostly reliable, but I can't say it's 100% reliable, as I've had to use other antivirus scanners/spyware and rootkit scanners to catch things that Norton has missed. Recently, this company has started an onslaught of spamming where their installed product would pop-up with offers, invites to sign up for beta products and repeated mailings staying I am ""not protected"" (referring to there be no installation of a subscription that they already know has either expired or cancelled and showing their are other products that I'm subscribed to that are installed and active.) This company has repeatedly demonstrated incompetence in  that despite calling and emailing them that I don't need this ""not protected"" reminders and to modify their systems to be more intelligent about when they are sent out (that is check that the customer is using another subscription), they still send them out."
338781,1.0,2018,Great Product.

338785,-1.0,2018,I purchased this item for my iMac that was infected with malware.  It has done absolutely nothing!  The power eraser advertised only works for Windows so this product is a total waste of money for Mac user.  So disappointed!  If I would give it ZERO stars I would.
338806,1.0,2018,100 % OK
338807,1.0,2018,This was such a quick and easy purchase!!! I received the code and was able to install it on my computer and phone with no problem.
338808,1.0,2018,Good Deal
338809,-1.0,2018,locked up my mac running High Sierra.  I could not get on internet or connect to other mac's on my network.  I had to uninstall and reboot multiple times to get to time machine to recover.
338810,1.0,2018,Seems to have done its job after a year of use and apparently no problem with viruses so far.
338811,1.0,2018,"Would recommend Norton was very easy to download,"
338812,1.0,2018,Great price
338813,1.0,2018,"Really thankful for Amazon digital services combined with the online support of Norton.  After purchase had difficulty activating the software. I've purchased Norton online in past years with no problems, however the Norton customer support person did a fantastic job of assisting me in real time and keeping my machines safe.  Great Price, Great Product.  Thank you"
338814,1.0,2018,seems to do the job
338815,1.0,2018,love norton and this was a good price thru amazon thanks
338836,-1.0,2018,Didn't  down load and still had to pay for it!!
338837,1.0,2018,"After searching on the web through Amazon I found a reasonably price protection package from Norton. the same package through Norton's website was extremely high priced. I have been using Norton for quite a number of years and so far, knock on wood, I have not had any problems with virus or spyware."

338839,-1.0,2018,"Item was not what I expected, No instruction in how to install"
338840,1.0,2018,Satisfied.  Have reordered this product.
338842,1.0,2018,it is a good product
338843,-1.0,2018,Product key invalid
338845,1.0,2018,"Top rated by Consumer Reports.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to offer any intuitive way to get an in-depth look at its scanning logs.  After a scan, I always seem to get 2 ""threats"" that are ""fixed"".  What were the threats?  Where did they come from?  Should I be concerned?  Most annoying of all, Norten seems to think that I bought--oh, sorry--rented this software so that they can constantly interrupt my work with adds for their other products.  Once is enough!  Where is the just-say-no button.  Hmm, I wonder if they sell a pop-up blocker to block themselves.  Summary:  according to Consumer Reports, Norten is the best product, overall, for fighting malware, but it is extremely annoying."
338856,1.0,2018,good
338857,1.0,2018,Easy install; good product; great value at Amazon..
338858,1.0,2018,Good
338859,-1.0,2018,Easy to download but the goofy thing will not install. I cannot speak to a customer service rep that isn't trying to sell me the upgrade and may think Im an idiot.
338860,1.0,2018,great price
338861,1.0,2018,Useful.
338862,1.0,2018,"Norton Security Deluxe is easy to install. It bought this as a renewal. However, I found out later that the renewal price on the Norton app is the same as this price. This tool has a dashboard that shows you the state of how secured your system is, and you can fix it just by clicking a button. Easy enough!"
338863,1.0,2018,I have been using Norton security deluxe for some years and never had a problem with it.
338864,1.0,2018,good
338865,-1.0,2018,"This was a renewal and it is much cheaper and easier to just buy directly from Norton for $29. Be prepared to jump through numerous screens and enter the key code through the ""Help"" feature on your installed Norton on your machines."
338876,1.0,2018,"So far, so good. I have used Norton for many years and have never had a problem installing the software or with viruses, etc. The five device software is perfect for the two of us, phones plus laptops and PC. I have recommended it to others."
338877,1.0,2018,does what it's suppose too
338878,-1.0,2018,"I am updating my post as Norton help chat was able to fix my problem but what a pain.  their site kept indicating that my version of Mac OS was not supported and to use it on another device.  it took over 90 minutes for their tech to fix on their chat line taking over my laptop remotely and manually doing the install.  it works fine now but I still wonder about the amount of hassle to use this software with Mac High Sierra.  no longer pursuing a refund but also note that it is damn near impossible to get a refund on software purchased from Norton through amazon.  Amazon doesn't offer the choice of getting a refund and Amazon and Norton says they cannot entertain refunds on software sold on Amazon.  Shame on both of them.  Robbed over three hours of my Sunday trying to get it to work, then trying to get a refund and then endless time with the service tech from Norton.  hard to call this experience deluxe."
338880,1.0,2018,excellent product at a super price
338881,1.0,2018,always works
338882,-1.0,2018,"Software is ok, but you can get the same for a cheaper price else where. What becomes very annoying is how often they want you to renew. And when you go with a different product and decide to not renew, you receive pop ups every half hour asking - no, begging - you to renew."
338883,1.0,2018,Great protection
338884,-1.0,2018,This mediocre product is very intrusive with your personal dat and information. I would never buy it again.

338911,-1.0,2018,"Buy Bitdefender. I truly believe that Norton is a very good security product. And, this is actually a very good deal (5 devices, etc.) if it works. It didn't work for me -- not at all. It would absolutely not install (Windows 10). I contacted Norton Support. I was told what to do. Even though I had already done those things, I did them again. No dice. The Support Rep. asked me to give over remote access to my computer. I did this (I was absolutely desperate). For more than an hour the Rep tried to remotely install the software. I watched. Pretty terrifying. After an hour, I was told that the issue needed to be ""escalated"" and that someone who know more would contact me ""on Monday"" when the qualified people come to work. No one contacted me, and, to be honest, I was relieved because I don't like giving control of my computer to someone far off who doesn't actually speak my language very well. It's uncomfortable. It seems to me that a person should be able to install security software that he/she has purchased. Right? I wish luck to anyone who can't resist this good deal, but I recommend Bitdefender. I am asking for a refund. We'll see."
338913,1.0,2018,Works effectively and seamlessly to protect me on the internet.
338914,-1.0,2018,Scammy auto-renewal (default option) that will charge your credit card at renewal time for an amount far more than street price if you don't opt out.
338915,-1.0,2018,"The product itself works well, however, it protecting five user is not true. I followed the instructions and entered the emails of my son and wife. They never received any emails from Norton with instructions of how to install the software on their computers. And yes I did enter their email addresses correctly. Very disappointed."
338926,-1.0,2018,Norton will Cheat you out of subscription time
338928,1.0,2018,easy to install. well worth the price.

338930,1.0,2018,"Call me old fashioned but I prefer a disk to download a program from, but anyway.  So far all is ok.  They've seemed to have added a count down to keep track of how many licenses you bought.  So on one of the screens Norton tells you how many of the versions you've used compared to the number of devices you have a license for.  If Norton can avoid telling me every month that my trial version has expired, I'll be really impressed.  (I never bought a trial version of Norton, not ever)."
338931,1.0,2018,Convenient
338932,1.0,2018,It's easy to install and gives me a peace of mind.
338934,1.0,2018,"This application is great and i trust that my computer is taken care of. I've never found these security applications to be very visually appealing applications and this is no different. Hard to have fun in computer security I suppose. That being said, I can always understand what is going on with my computer and there is nothing wrong with the application or the functionality. It simply gets the job done."
338946,1.0,2018,"I have been using Norton Security for years and have found it to be an excellent product that is user friendly.  Less than one minute after placing my order on Amazon, I received the Norton product key code.  I already had Norton Security on my devices and just plugged the key code into my current Norton Security and it instantly added the one year.  Quick & easy.
My only issue with Norton Security is how it plays with the latest addition of Firefox.  I no longer get the search results safe site ""green/gray/red markers"" when I do a search from my Yahoo home page search box.  This feature still works properly in Google Chrome."
338947,1.0,2018,"Love this Norton Security, very easy to install and see what its doing. Was able to protect all my home computers."
338948,1.0,2018,Norton always was and always will be I imagine the best AV and Network security software out there. I've used it for years and i've never had a virus or intrusion on my network where as others I know who use other top shelf AV software have been bombarded with SPAM and other trash as well as infection from viruses. GET THIS if you want to know you're safe on your PC.

338972,-1.0,2018,Ive bought it by mistake ...i coludn t use it in may pc or mobile
338975,0.0,2018,works fine for the PC's but Norton forces me to go to Google for the Android downloads.  Google will not let me get past to logins there so it is useless for the smartphone.-  They need to do the android downloads at Norton proper.

339005,1.0,2018,"Seems to be all good. A year ago I bought a new laptop and gave Kaspersky a try.  It was cumbersome. I'd used Norton previously.  So, when it was time to purchase this year's protection I went back to Norton."
339006,1.0,2018,download it right when you purchase it.  don't waite.  went quick.
339007,1.0,2018,"Pretty sweet!  I had a previously installed version of Norton Deluxe on my machine and it was expiring.  I bought the key code and received it electronically.  Then I went to Norton Deluxe on my pc, hit help, hit ""Enter Product Key"", did as instructed and et voila, back in bidness.  All done in less time than flushing an Australian toilet (wait, what?) -- terrible analogy but you get the picture.  No muss, no fuss; good for another year."

339014,-1.0,2018,I bought for 5 computers but it only installed on one and then started giving me error message.

339056,1.0,2018,"I first got introduced to Norton, due to my initial Windows computer including a free 30 day subscription of Norton. After subscription  expired, I renewed it. That was a while ago. Ive been purchasing Norton Security since it was called Norton Internet Security (insert current year). I use it on several Windows PCs and notebooks. The operating systems of my computers are Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8.1. Norton works great on all of them. It doesn't slow down any of my computers. I've never had a Virus on any of my computers. Norton does what it says, which is protect my computers from viruses. I just renewed it Today by punching in my new product key code.

To insert product key code into your Norton, simply click on the Norton Security icon on your computer. Click on ""Norton Help Center."" Look under ""Account Information."" There should be a link that says ""Enter Product Key."" Click on ""Enter Product Key."" Then copy and paste product key from your amazon order history (digital purchases). You will be renewed!

Don't renew from Norton unless their deal is lower than Amazon. The best time to purchase Norton is around the Holiday season (4th quarter) and from Amazon. You get the best deal around that time. Plus, with Amazon, and around the Holiday season (4th quarter), you can get their 15 month exclusive version of Norton Security. I didn't get it last year because I waited too late to renew (since I had 3 extra months remaining and didn't need it until now). Now it's unavailable in 15 month version. I'll be sure to get that version Holiday 2018 so I can get three free months."

When I tried to do it the usual way, it told me to finish on the home page. I had to search the home page for a place to put a product code since it was almost hidden. Long gone are the days when you can find it on the renew page. After I downloaded it, it did not renew. I spent more time attempting all the Help suggestions and still no renew. It said I only had a trial version loaded and to renew now. I came across a note on one of the help pages that said some key codes are invalid and cannot be used. That scared me a lot since I spent the money to buy a key code already.

I tried doing the entire process again and still it did not renew. I tried looking for another way to try to load my Amazon Key Code and I stumbled onto one and tried it. The third time looked different so I was hopeful. After this one loaded it said I was updated for another year. I wish I knew where I found that last key code entry page so I could post it here. I think once you download the software and activate your key card you have to do another step that they don't tell you. I was so frazzled at that point that I think I found it entirely on accident, but I believe I had to register it.

It's a mess, but I wanted to warn everyone that it is not easy to use a key code anymore. I'm sure Norton wants everyone to buy from them and that is why they are making it harder to use a code from elsewhere. To be fair to Norton, I could have done this during a time when they are changing the site or doing the process differently, maybe they plan on posting clearer instructions for anyone who wishes to use a key code from another company, but I get a feeling that's not the case.

As for the software itself, in the past five years I've never had problems with Norton. I always felt protected and secure. It ran in the background silently and did not slow down my computer. It warned me about security issues and blocked a few attacks I received. I will see how this new renewal does this year and edit my review accordingly. Unfortunately, I do not plan on using Norton next year when it expires again. I don't like companies that do not care about their customers and I will be more than happy to go to someone who wants my business and is more honest."
339063,-1.0,2018,I have been on able to install it on High Sierra and iOS 11 without without it causing huge problems across my network. If I wouldve known that this was not the 2018 version I would not have purchased it  its not relevant and it does not work properly on High Sierra
339064,1.0,2018,Thanks
339065,1.0,2018,Easy download and easy install...great price!
339076,1.0,2018,always stand up for Norton product
339077,1.0,2018,"This was a great buy on Amazon!  Almost half price and it is good up to 5 devices.  Downloading and installing was easy and it seems to be working just fine.  Norton offers up help if needed with the installation, don't be afraid to buy it.  I have used Norton in the past and it was good, except I thought it slowed down my computer so I stopped using it for the past several years and now decided to try it once again and I am happy.  Thanks Amazon!"
339078,-1.0,2018,"Every year norton's seems to find new ways to frustrate their customers.

It installs fine on my first system - then gets convoluted on the next system.

Ugh - I still have another system to install it on.

I truly am starting to hate norton's for the time I waste trying to install it

The next time I install an anti-virus - I think I'll look around"
339079,1.0,2018,It was good at the time of the price.
339080,1.0,2018,VERY VERY GOOD
339081,0.0,2018,The product seems to work as usual.  I already had Norton and was just updating my subscription. Although I went through the renew process they cut off what was left of the previous subscription.  Lost about 2 weeks.  Next year I will shop around instead of just renewing.
339082,1.0,2018,Worked great! Easy to install and keeps my protected and can use on multiple devices.
339083,1.0,2018,So far so good. No complaints.
339084,1.0,2018,"Works well. Glad they stopped supporting the NRA. I like the feature that tells you what apps could be sending personal info. My new Samsung Galaxy had a default app that it found. Not sure how thorough it is about identifying, e.g., Google apps collecting data for marketing research."
339085,1.0,2018,"I like how simple it is to install, it's also not bad on resources. The cons however are with threats. It seems to do an OK job at detecting them, but it doesn't always do a good job at dealing with the threats. I've had a two occasions where it would detect which I had to reinstall to resolve the issues."
339106,-1.0,2018,Product didn't work on Norton website and there isn't any contact information to contact seller.
339108,0.0,2018,"Product is fine but shame on Norton for making it almost impossible to find the place to enter a product key to renew your subscription.  Norton wants to increase profits by getting you to renew directly through them because (1) the price is higher on their site, (2) they keep all the money instead of sharing it with Amazon.  If you try to renew your subscription using a product key used here by clicking on ""renew"" you just keep landing at the Norton Store where you can buy a renewal from them.  They have removed ""I have a Key"" or any mention of product keys from that place.  The instructions here are Amazon no longer correct.  You have to go into the ""help"" on your Norton product and look in the lower right corner for ""Enter Product Key"".  Ridiculously hard to find.  Had to find the answer on a product forum.  As for the protection, I've never had any problems or issues.  Product updates regularly and seems to provide solid protection but I'll leave it to computer experts to assess the quality of protection."
339109,1.0,2018,So far so good.  Great buy.
339110,-1.0,2018,"Purchased this for my laptop.  Followed directions to install. After inputting the Product Key, my computer screen said there was a problem with the installation and provided a phone number to call for assistance. I called and an individual answered saying he was Norton tech support and would be happy to help me with the installation. He said he needed access to my computer and I allowed it. He indicated that my computer had a number of viruses and malware and stated that he would need to clean it before he could install the Norton software.  He also indicated that this was not a. free service and would at a minimum cost $150.  I foolishly told him to go ahead. Bottom line, after 3 hours he said my computer was now cleaned and Norton was now installed and working. He then went into a sales pitch for additional coverages available. The additional features sounded good so I wrote a check for $400.  Later I started wondering about this transaction so I called Norton directly and found out that the whole thing was a scam. Norton could not do anything to help me out. Neither could Amazon. Very expensive lesson. If you buy be aware of the possibility of getting caught in the scam."
339111,1.0,2018,"I was looking for an Antivirus for my Mac and this was on sale for a substantially reduced price on Amazon. If you're not familiar with computer antivirus programs, the first thing to be mindful of is will it require a lot of CPU? essentially that just means will it use up a lot of your computer memory. Norton has been known at times to use a lot of computer memory, but if you have a relatively up to date computer you should be fine. I find this program very useful, the ONLINE download that I bought gave me no problems when I entered the key code in. Also, it lets you use it on 5 devices. Awesome!"
339112,1.0,2018,good product
339113,1.0,2018,It works Ok not great.

339132,1.0,2018,"I'm a long time IT security professional (CISSP) and have used this is the product for years for my personal laptops, computers, phones and tablets.  Works on Android, IOS (iPhone and iPad) , Windows.  The five license package is a bargain and is easy to install from the email link.  You can run the default set-up and pretty much forget about it once it is installed, or tweak a wide array of settings to deal with you personal preferences and needs. Nice features like VPN, email and web browser support and add-ins if you choose to use them.  Integrates well with Windows.  I purchased this from Amazon since it is a trusted source."

So I'm out my $40ish, and annoyed af (no refunds! buyer beware)......there MUST be a better option. Just to reiterate, this made me want to throw my laptop out into the street."

If you automatically renew through Norton, you will pay over $100.00.  Make sure you undo the automatic renew option if you already have Norton Security, and if you can't go to live chat and have them do it.  Then, when next year rolls around and it's time to upgrade to the next year's model, get it again on Amazon and save a bundle."

Really annoying and they wanted to use a lot of the system resources. Just like bloat ware.

339315,0.0,2018,"I have been using this product for many years, purchasing a new product key from Amazon instead of renewing directly with Norton, understanding fully the consequence of losing a few days of subscription by not waiting until the expiration date, but this year it has been much more difficult to do this.  Previously, you could bring up the Norton screen, click on Renew, the click on ""Have Product Code"", simply enter the code and within seconds, your subscription was renewed to 365 days.  That option no longer exists.  When you click on Renew, it directs you to their page where you have to purchase it from them.  I contacted Norton, and they told me to sign onto Norton.com/setup and enter the product key.  At that point, it goes through and entire download and installation process.  I have not yet figured out how to get it on to additional devices since it is a 5 device version, but I suspect that same process of download and install will be required.  This is a big pain!!  I can't believe a company as great as Norton has stooped to this level to try to force you to buy directly from them.  Very disappointed.  I certainly hope the security and protection is as good as it has always been.  I would really hate to change to something else.  Not cool!!"

Foolishly I thought this would be a safe place to download software but after downloading it I found it had changed the names of my virtual drives.  I never ran the program and tried to change the names of the virtual drives back to no avail.  I started a chat with a tech and even though I related the problem exactly before we started, he took  hour going back and forth and taking control of my computer to tell me that he would not work on any non-Symantec software.  I couldn't believe it!  Also Identity Safes memory is getting disorientated as it will occasionally forget a login and password.  The last straw was when the program started popping up ads on my desk top last year.

I can't say for sure since nothing has turned up yet, which is fine with me. I can say that Norton, particularly on my Android devices, is incredibly naggy. It scans and scans and scans. I assume they know why. And maybe it should, I don't know. What drove me nuts is the ""Norton Clean"" portion  on my 32gb phone. In three years I've accumulated @20Gb of storage. But in less than a year, Norton found a total of
over  100Gb of junk files and other cleanable stuff. How did I not max out without it? It supposedly found 1Gb of junk files""  nearly every day.  Then there are other notifications and emails. Nag nag nag. PC, not as much. I recently renewed, but for  PC only.  May go back to Lookout for tab and phone. My bank uses Norton, obviously a much more complex and customized version ( I hope), but I figured thats worth something. One more thing. Like some others I've had; Norton automatically puts you on "" auto renewal"" then promptly punishes THEIR CUSTOMERS who dare to continue service, by auto billing 2-4 times what you can you can get here. Sick policy.  Turning off auto renewal; they make it sound like you will be cancelling your service with them.  Amazon has very reasonable price, cheap even. So yes, in the end, I did renwew.

It's because Norton has other stuff to sell, or, half the time, they just like e-mailing you garbage and reminders that you've already purchased their product. But, is that all? Of course not, this is a premium product! Every single time you turn on your computer, Norton will suggest you do something - like, download a browser extension which you have already done, and checked that you've done, several times.

I have noticed, however, that Norton prices are all over the map, and they will hit one with their highest prices if one ""auto-renews"" from Norton itself.  I bought this version on Amazon to update an expiring subscription, and the reason I am giving it a maximum rating is that the product code went right through, renewing my present Norton.

I went through the whole Chat Support and Forum Support process to figure this out, set network trust to full, uninstalled Norton, reinstalled Norton, all to no avail. I have to uninstall or stop the program just to get onto my own router, which I need to do from time to time.

I've seen other forum posts on their site complaining about Lenovo computers and this software, so I'm likely just going to call this a complete loss of money and go back to the other AV I've used for 7 years which may or may not be a front for the CIA or Russian Government.

EDIT: Updating review, after about two and a half hours with a tech from Norton and a Supervisor we got it working today, in the most odd way I've ever seen (hand editing a device driver location in Regedit), I'm bumping it up because the techs ended up being quite helpful and skilled, however I'm keeping it at 3 because nobody would ever be able to figure that out through casual use and it took almost three hours of my day to get resolved, after a few days of hunting down other solutions."
339393,0.0,2018,"This Norton product seems to work well enough, and updates are easy. A full, comprehensive scan needs an online connection to run, and on my new desktop running Windows 10, takes almost 2 hours to finish the scan. A quick scan can run offline, and takes about 10 minutes to finish.
This was an Amazon Special, and was supposed to come with a ""15 month"" coverage, but when I installed it, I found out that it would only last for 12 months, instead of the advertised 15 months."
339416,1.0,2018,"Good product for the discounted purchase price with an option to install in five devices. Thereafter learn to live with Norton that would like to take complete charge of your computer - as you would with a WIFE who would nag & nudge you to fall in line with her ways as long as she remains with you. You could feel that you are being ""brain-washed"" on all matters of Computer Security.."
339417,-1.0,2018,"I downloaded this software, restarted my iMac, and the previously well-behaved iMac would not reboot, even in safe mode.  Over $600 later, and 2.5 days at the computer shop, my computer now works again.  Only after buying this did I see many warnings NOT to use Norton for Macs, it is not needed, and is ""buggy.""  That last is an understatement.  If you have a Mac, don't buy this."
339418,1.0,2018,"Initially, I had a license key recognition issue with Norton. Called Amazon, and got help from one of their software reps. He guided me through the installation process, and shortly,  Norton was up and running. Next day, I downloaded Norton on my other laptop with no issues. So far, Norton works great, and I am very happy with it. Easy to use and understand. Also, I had a great purchase price with Amazon."
339419,1.0,2018,"I have used Norton products for many years and will continue to do it, because it really is top of the line protection."
339420,1.0,2018,Great product. Keeps my computer safe.
339421,1.0,2018,Always trust Norton's products.
339422,-1.0,2018,Did not use it. Also I understand we cannot return this item.
339423,1.0,2018,We only use Norton for our devices.  For over 5 years it has kept us safe from online threats.  We had McaFee before that but one of our PC's was infected with ransomware anyway and had to be reformatted.
339424,-1.0,2018,can't download the product and no useful help from Amazon's automated system. Wasted money.
339435,-1.0,2018,No support. only worked on one computer. rip off.
339437,-1.0,2018,"I followed all the instructions to the letter. I got the Product Key. I maneuvered my way around to find a clear instruction to start downloading and ALL my attempts to download the SW failed. And I suppose I still have 4 more system.

If I don't get a clear instructions based on the product code I have, I don't really need this hassle and refund my payment or send me a downloadable disk."
339438,1.0,2018,"I'm throughly impressed with Norton Security Deluxe. First, the price offered here on Amazon is excellent - a significant discount off purchasing at retail outlets or through Symantec. The interface is easy to use, and has a variety of scan options + settings to adjust the firewall and application permissions. The online administration panel is great for checking on devices in other locations. All in all, after evaluating several anti-virus competitors, I'm happy to have chosen Norton Security Deluxe by Symantec."

339462,1.0,2018,Great product and Awesome price.
339463,1.0,2018,On some computers I did an UPGRADE.  On others I had to REMOVE the previous version.  On some computers it gave me the additional unexpired days on others 365 days even if I had 7 unexpired days.
339465,0.0,2018,"This is probably the last time I use Norton. First of all this product would not install on 5 devices. It kept insisting that this was only a 3 license product. Got on chat with a support agent that had difficulty communicating clearly, but after some time we got it fixed. They changed the product internally and I just had to reactivate on all my machines.

While annoying, this by itself would not have made me dump Norton. Its their constant advertising and scare tactics. I don't want to use lifelock, it had a terrible reputation before Symantec bought it. I also already have a different better password manager. Stop bugging me about your IDsafe. Norton's used to break every time Firefox updated forcing me to buy a different product. I'm sure its gotten better, but why change from something I'm already very satisfied with? Besides the regular advertising (my PC is not a TV !) scare tactics like with the Krack vulnerability really annoys me. This vulnerability affects wifi, but if you are on a wired network at home, guess what it doesn't affect you. Not everything is vulnerable to this. Also many products have patches for this vulnerability. This is all about pushing their products and I've got other things to do then be distracted by advertising."
339468,1.0,2018,"Always, best internet security."
339469,-1.0,2018,"This review is for the mac version. Norton has a several-year history of annoying pop ups that have presented themselves in many flavors. These became so cumbersome for me in the last version that I eventually decided to uninstall and not renew. Previous pop ups would eventually give you the option of ""Do not ask me again"", but this is not the case anymore at least for installation of the toolbar. There are many reasons why one may choose not to install the toolbar and this is something that should not be forced on the user. It's a pity, because the software works relatively well otherwise. It's time for me to try a different vendor."

340539,1.0,2018,We buy this every year. Good protection.
340540,0.0,2018,"My Norton was about to expire and added the 3 pc download to my cart for $23 last week and when I go to renew today price had gone to $59, guess I can wait until they have another sale they keep juggling the prices.. That is the price for early renewal because you are not credited the time period you still have remaining and will Not play that game.."
340541,1.0,2018,Great price for a good amount of protection
340542,-1.0,2018,I need a refund on this product. Can't use it on Kindle Fires. Norton says Amazon must refund.

340608,1.0,2018,thanks
340620,1.0,2018,Got to have protection
340621,1.0,2018,I installed this on my computer and it did slow my computer down quite a bit.  I had to disable some of its features to get my computer to run at a normal speed.  I have used other Norton products before with no issues.  It would take 45-60 seconds just to open and internet browser with all the features turned on.
340622,1.0,2018,"Been using it for years, and I love it"

340639,-1.0,2018,This is sold as 3 device download but I was only able to install it on one PC. Then I was unable to access my new Norton account because my password did not work. We I was able to get a new password the Norton setup page kept telling me my license expired. I checked the subscription in my new account and it showed a product that was expired 2011. I am a fan of both Amazon and Norton but either they are rip off or My Norton subscription got ripped off.  I had ordered a copy ID Guard on line and the package arrived empty -no disk no license. I tried returning the package and stated in two different Emails that there was no disk no license but the would not refund or exchange. Now I have tried a download and I pay for a license for 3 PC's and can only put it on one. I question and you should too if Amazon can deliver software in a secure fashion. Also NOTE if something does go wrong there is little of nothing you can do- If it gets stolen -you pay NOT Amazon.
340640,-1.0,2018,My computer crashed after installing this

340646,-1.0,2018,"This works reasonably well, but Symantec does not support the Bill Of Rights.  Since Symantec stopped supporting the NRA, I can no longer support a company that does not protect my self-defense rights.

340673,1.0,2018,It protects all my devices well and have had no issues with this product.  I buy it from Amazon digitally even when it's time to renew.  Good product to protect your mobile devices as well.

340694,-1.0,2018,"This is my last Norton Security purchase.  Every year it is a pain in the *ss to install.  This year it crashed my computer.  After taking 30 minutes to remove the old version it asked to restart.  I did, the computer didn't.  Absolutely would not boot back up.  After spending two hours trying everything the computer suggested multiple times I gave up.  It is now at a repair center, hopefully, getting restored.  Repair guy said this isn't that unusual with Norton."
340695,-1.0,2018,About 3 days after purchasing this and downloading it to my computer I had to take my computer in because it wouldn't let me on to the internet. The computer tech had to remove Norton because he said that was what was causing the problem. With that being said after spending $90 my computer is fixed without Norton.
340696,-1.0,2018,I bought this and doesnt works me in Ecuador - South America. I want a refund.
340697,1.0,2018,Amazon was great on giving code but norton them self all thieves . As i tried to setup account error came up and said i had to call norton so i did. Once connected they said my computer had so many issues blah blah that i had to buy a package protection for 150$ . I caught on right away was a money sheme and hung up. Tried second time to activate code and worked fine . So BEWARE
340698,1.0,2018,I have always used Norton. It offers the best protection for your computers.

341327,1.0,2018,"Bought this before my Norton subscription expired because I didn't want to pay the Norton renewal price. I received the download code right away however I waited until 2 days before my subscription expired to activated this one. i would have waited till the last day but time didn't permit. I activated it without any problems and have used 7/10 licenses on windows laptop, desktop, mac, android phone and ipad. No problems what so ever, will order online from Amazon again next year if it is available then"
341328,1.0,2018,"fast delivery, love it"
341329,1.0,2018,"This product has an extensive range of features and a functional, relatively straight-forward user interface that I like.  It automatically updates and doesn't noticeably slow down my laptop or desktop performance, and has blocked any number of malicious attacks, cleaned up tracking cookies, etc.  I use its nice backup feature for all 3 of my machines.  Aside from my own positive experience for years with this product, I've noticed that it has performed quite well in independent tests of security software."
341330,-1.0,2018,"I had gotten a two year subscription to the product previously, and technically, it worked OK, however when I started getting the nagging messages to renew, I checked the prices. If you renew through the Norton app, they want twice what it can be bought here on Amazon.  And according to all the help instructions, all you have to do is log into your Norton account and insert the new product key into each of your devices.  Let me say, that I struggled and struggled and ended up having to install it locally at each machine. This method took over an hour on each machine.  Even then, the Norton account manager says it can not ""see"" any of the machines. Locally, on each machine, it says it is operating fine.  Just so you know, while no expert, I am reasonably tech-savy, so this was extremely frustrating.  On top of all the installation problems, I notice now that each machine is now running considerably slower than before.

So, I will be looking for a better alternative before next renewal.  I might even dump Norton before the end of the subscription if the machine's performance does not improve."
341331,1.0,2018,"Great product, you can always trust Norton."
341332,1.0,2018,Used for a renewal on my present subscription. The code was sent and installed. For the inexpensive price it covers 10 computers or tablets. This is the cheapest price I have found for Norton.
341333,1.0,2018,Great value for my business.  No problems with installation or authentication.
341334,1.0,2018,It worked very well. Glad it was available..
341335,1.0,2018,"It's worth it!!  The Microsoft default anti-virus can't defend all the virus, but this Norton is perfect.  It's a piece of mind that you don't have to worry when you browser the internet."
341366,1.0,2018,Good
341367,-1.0,2018,"Unlike other software renewals, Norton does not add the new purchases term to the remaining days as stated in product description and as advised I waited till I had 1 day left before installing the new software.

The downloaded software loader was problematic.  It gave installation error code on a Windows 10 PC.  Since I had the previous software license still valid for 1 day,  I simply entered the new product Key in the already installed software and it worked.  But instead of getting 15 months as described if you download the software (purchased on Prime day), I only got 366 days.

Once that worked, I used the feature to send a link to install on other devices via email.

Used the emailed link on another device running Windows 7.  Abject failure again. On windows 7, I spent hours of time doing multiple restarts. I went to their support site which said I had to download their Removal and Uninstall tool and first Remove the old Norton Software (requires a restart), and then download their software again and install it.  Again it said only 1 day left since it seemed to remember my old product key.  Entered the new product key and it worked, but have only 366 days renewal instead of 15 months.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-Premium-10-Devices-Download-Code/dp/B015724RQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security Premium - 10 Devices [Download Code</a>]

341368,1.0,2018,"I previously worked for Best Buy's Geek Squad and hated computers with Norton. My Fiance purchased this a year ago, I installed it on 8 devices (computers, tablets, & smartphones). It is so much better than it was a few years ago. Is no longer a resource hog, slowing the devices down. The extra features make it a great all in one security program.  This was purchased as our first one-year subscription was running out. Didn't have to uninstall it, just added the new security key provided by Amazon to each device."

It would take me few hundreds of dollars to get it fix so I just decided to purchase a new MacBook Air because I'm in nursing school, and I have so many assignments. I spent my $40 or so dollars with this and it broke my windows XP. If you don't want this experience please think before you purchase.

341429,1.0,2018,"This is a deal, is the top of the line Norton product and download as needed, up to 10 devices. 12 months on all downloads begin when the first download is activated."
341430,-1.0,2018,"The software does the job, I suppose.  I generally don't visit risky sites, and am uber careful about opening emails/links - so I suppose it's hard to tell.

That being said - the product constantly annoys me with pop-ups and ""suggested"" add-on features.  This is a huge disappointment and turn-off to Norton in general - mostly because I pay yearly for a subscription.  For that reason I would absolutely not recommend Norton.  I plan on switching to BitDefender when my subscription is up."
341431,1.0,2018,"After being a fan of Kaspersky Internet Security for the past 12 years, I decided to give Norton a try, since it was on sale at an unreasonably low price. I can install this on up to 10 computers. Turned out to be a satisfactory purchase!"

341481,1.0,2018,Wait for your current one to expire then insert the new key. If you do it the other way you regret it!
341483,-1.0,2018,Purchase the code on Amazon to renew.  The program prompts you as a reminder so I hit renew now where they do not give you the ability to enter a code.  I then following the instructions on the link from Amazon.  It then prompts me for a credit card and can either cancel or hit auto-renew.  I hit cancel and it appears to update my account.  Then I exit the site and the application is still saying my subscription expired. I uninstall and try to reinstall.  Still says it expired.  Will not another Norton product after this since installing and registering a product should not be such a pain in the...
341484,1.0,2018,"This is a edit to my previous 1-star. i titled it with ""Does not work with i-7 Processor PCs.""  and ahe now changed it.  I owe you all and Norton a apology!  Seems i goggles ""Norton Support phone number.""  and got a fake, bad-guy acting like Norton.  I was suspicious as the first thing, he wanted to remote in my PC!  And argued with me till i hung up on him.  I shoulda known!
  However, i called a real Norton number and whas majorly and professionally helped by level 2 support.  This very professional tech named Vinoy Kumar was one of the best support techs i have ever worked with, and totally solved my issue, cleaning out all the redundant Norton files throughout the registry and appdata folders, until the PC was much faster, and had Norton installed perfectly!
  I do have some advice.  As these bad guys get more and more tricky.  First, always be suspicious if anyone wants to remote into your PC!  It should be very rare.  But do as i did.  Even with Vinoy, i casually asked him a few questions which i knew the answers.  I asked him where he was?  I asked what is the time in India?  He gave me the correct time.  I then asked him how many licenses i had and again he was correct.  So I remain a very satified Norton user!  At least 10 years since the first NIS came out and no virus's!  Also, if i fix anyone's PC, usually free, if they don't get Norton, it's the last free fix!  And what's up with other reviewers talking about resources?  Since NIS, they have always been rated highly on recourses!  The only complaint i have is too much ads now for their other products.  But i have given them feedback and can choose the ""Don't ask again.""  Just my 8 cents worth!"
341485,1.0,2018,Good value
341486,1.0,2018,great
341487,-1.0,2018,This really slows my computers down compared to the other antiviruses I have had. I like the multiple licenses.

341506,-1.0,2018,Fast I wish price was most stable rather than changing constantly I bought it at the price that NORTON Sales. So just wait until droop again
341508,1.0,2018,Kept me safe for years now. Some performance issues. But worth it when you don't have to reload the computer often.

341546,1.0,2018,Great price and product. Intrusive until you disable all the unnecessary portions
341547,1.0,2018,Item arrived promptly as described and a great value.
341548,1.0,2018,As advertised.
341549,1.0,2018,Does a good job protecting my computers and at a great price.
341550,-1.0,2018,"It wasn't made clear in the literature available during purchase that all this would do for our iPhones was back up our contacts. No other protections.

Not sure what it's doing for our Kindle Fires - have had some issues with the Silk browser locking with what looks like bogus ""prize"" links and no way out except to close down and reboot.

I certainly didn't need to pay for 10 subscriptions for that kind of ""security"".

When I emailed to complain, I got a reply that basically said Yesh, we don't cover iPhones. Sorry. No offer of a refund between the price I paid and the 5-device protection plan.

Looking for a different vendor with better security now."
341551,-1.0,2018,"What a joke. I thought I was purchasing protection for my iPad and all it protects are my contacts and in case I lose the phone. A cloud service is all it is and a ""scream""?  Absolutely useless to me for my iPad. Probably similar to the iphone, but do not know as I have an Android phone and now will not even attempt to install it. I save my contacts to my home computer and can use another phone to call my phone should I misplace it, which is what we have done since owning them.... wth? I have never felt more naive in purchasing anything until I got this. I did not purchase it from Amazon (it was cheaper here by $10) but I needed it instantly and bought it from a local retailer. As far as I can tell it is working on my Windows 10 laptop.
Do not expect anything from this device for an iPad (and probably any tablet or phone) - it was a marketing tool and sadly, it worked on me."
341552,1.0,2018,Norton is the best
341553,1.0,2018,"It works and it's much less expensive than buying direct from Norton. You get a download, use their link and type in the activation code. Let it install and follow all of the steps until complete. You will be protected and you'll save some bucks"
341555,1.0,2018,have the price norton sells it for
341557,1.0,2018,"This was absolutely the most inexpensive way to renew by Norton subscription.  Requires some knowledge of how to download and install software but the instructions are adequate if you follow them closely. Warning, do not install until just a few days before an existing subscription ends because you will loose any unused days on you old subscription."
341558,1.0,2018,The security product I Trust
341559,-1.0,2018,"I have used Symantec products for years. But after they caved to leftist political pressure, and pulled their support from the NRA, I will no longer use Symantec products."

341578,1.0,2018,I like the product. I have used the same product for the last two years and I am satisfied with its performance.
341579,1.0,2018,Purchase this product each year and have always been satisfied. This year I required technical assistance form Norton which was great.
341582,1.0,2018,Great Price.  Great product.
341594,1.0,2018,excellent
341595,1.0,2018,The installation went without a hitch. It worked exactly as expected.
341597,-1.0,2018,This is the most deceiving way to sell a product that is only a month worrh of any computer protection.
341600,1.0,2018,"I have been using Norton for some time & it it easy to use for the family security system. Some people are more savvy than others, so the continuity is important. Seems to work across various platforms."
341601,1.0,2018,GOOD PRODUCT
341602,1.0,2018,Seemless install
341603,1.0,2018,It works and is easy to install on multiple machines/devices.
341605,-1.0,2018,Can't find th e product key in amazon been looking for it over a week now to hard should have just bought from best buy
341606,1.0,2018,"I have always trusted Norton products. This program works great, but you need to explore all the options Norton Security has to offer."
341607,1.0,2018,Best price Ive seen. I love Norton I haven't tried anything else but their products so its hard to really compare. But I haven't had any problems with it. Great customer support. I like the fact I can run a scan and still continue to do what I have to on the internet. The fact it tells you a site is shady before the page totally loads is great. No hesitation to shop on-line. Also warns you if there is not security on a page. I scan the whole computer for everything every couple of days before bed and it shuts down the whole computer after scan is complete. You can somehow all it to you mobile devices but Im not quite sure yet how to do that.
341608,-1.0,2018,THEY LIED ON THE TOP OF THE PAGE! DOES NOT RUN WITH WINDOWS 10!!!!!!
341610,1.0,2018,I ordered it because being able to use on 10 devices for the price of 1 device. i have shared it with my family
341611,1.0,2018,Good price!
341612,-1.0,2018,"The product is ok, but the Symantec company sucks big-time because of its anti-gun stance. . I will never buy anything from them in the future!"
341613,1.0,2018,"I have been using Norton Antivirus since it was invented, and it has always been good. This product installs cleanly and easily, has self-correction routines in case something -does- go wrong, and removes cleanly if necessary. Multi-pack installations like this 10-license-kit are easily managed: You can go to each station and download/launch the installer, or you can just email an install link to the user. They click on the link and the rest is automatic, perfect for novice recipients. The final thing of importance: Cost. This 10-pack sold for $39.99, or less than $4.00 per user, and even includes online backup services. Very good price for a professional-grade tool."
341614,1.0,2018,Always loves norton thanks
341615,-1.0,2018,The product has the features I want and is well-rated.  Only when they have your credit card information and are finalizing the purchase do they inform you that you are agreeing to automatic annual renewal.  Stupid short-sighted marketing trick.
341620,1.0,2018,"Good product, fair price."
341621,0.0,2018,"I bought this stand-alone package because the ""subscription"" service through Symantec is twice as expensive for half the number of devices.  Unfortunately, I purchased my copy through Costco (convenience), not Amazon.  Amazon is cheaper.

Installation on a Windows PC is fairly straight-forward, even if a previous version had been installed.  However, it was more difficult on mobile devices (both Android and iOS).  I had to fiddle a bit with the mobile devices to get them to update to the new version, usually requiring a log-in by selecting some option for added service (you don't need to enable the new option, just the login).  However, as I had to do with an iPhone, it may be simplest to just delete the existing mobile app, then re-install it.  Then Norton requires your login to activate the new app, and all gets set up properly.

However, I had to contact customer support to get one feature ""activated"" - a Computer Tune-Up (available only with the Costco option, I believe).  I followed the instructions to ""activate"" the feature online - the key code printed in the package just resulted in an error ""invalid code.""  I first spent a lot of time with the online chat - very long pauses and little attention from the support on chat.  Finally, they just told me I had to call a phone number.  Frustrating and time-consuming!  I then called the number, and again got put on long holds several times.  Their attempt to activate with my code also gave them ""invalid code"" - the phone support guy would never give me a reason for the problem, and never ""activated"" the feature.  He only offered to remotely take over my PC then and there, and spend 40 minutes doing unspecified things to my PC without my control or knowledge.  Turns out, this is what this ""Tune-up"" feature is - remote control of your PC by some stranger - this is not mentioned or described anywhere on the product information, or I would never have spent the time trying to activate the feature.  This ""remote control take-over"" would not work for me (metered internet connection, lack of trust based on the lack of knowledge exhibited by the phone contact person).  But even if I later wanted to use the service (like on a laptop that I could take somewhere without a metered connection) I could not do so, since the agent was unable or unwilling to activate the service (you had to activate it within 30 days, then you could use the service anytime later).  Since they would not honor my valid activation code, I had no option to use the service later if I decided to do so.  The support person just flippantly said I had to get a refund from the vendor (not likely, since I had already activated the other features in the package).

Anyway, the extra ""tune-up"" available with the Costco version may not be of use to you - so the Amazon version may be just as good, for a lower price.

There are indeed many pop-up ads while using this product.  I hate these intrusive and unwanted ads, and they are entirely inappropriate for a paid product!

Just note that the phone support person was very rude, not knowledgeable, and unhelpful - obviously customer satisfaction is very low on Symantec's priority list, and politics are high.  I've used Symantec's products for many years - they are really going downhill recently."
341623,1.0,2018,works great
341624,1.0,2018,"Have been using Norton for years. Good reputation, for me easy to use, and probably the best price for 10 devices without dealing with rebate."

341631,1.0,2018,"So far so good, support gave me an offline installer to make it easier to deploy.
It doesn't drag my system down like Mcafee and bitdefender did."
341633,1.0,2018,"Let's face it, nobody really wants all the excessive hand-holding the Norton products provide (or force). But this price for 10 devices, on sale, is great for a well-scoring antivirus package, and the protection thus far hasn't faltered. It's a good compromise between the no-cost Windows Defender and something twice the price. Just keep turning off all the ridiculous ""features"" they keep turning back on that have nothing to do with virus protection and aren't needed (like backups and disk management)."
341644,1.0,2018,"This has been excellent software, and has kept all my computers save and free from viruses."
341645,1.0,2018,It is a great product.
341646,1.0,2018,I have been using the Norton Security product for several years now and feel safer with it on my devices.  The price can vary quite a bit so I need to watch out for when it goes on sale so that I don't have to overpay for a renewal subscription.
341647,-1.0,2018,This product caused major problems with our computer.  Had to hire someone to fix it and install another anti virus product.  Never again!
341648,-1.0,2018,"Notice thta this has geographical restrictions and cannot be activated anywhere. I can not used it in south america, ask Norton Support and they told me that"
341649,1.0,2018,We have been very happy with Norton and its integration into our needs.
341651,1.0,2018,great price for what you get
341653,-1.0,2018,"I bought this primarily to put time limits on my kids iPad/iPhone usage. The software allows me to set allowed/blocked hours, but not set time total time limits. I checked with Norton support on this and they confirmed that Time Limits are not support on iOS. I think Norton could do a better job of differentiating features available on IOS compared to Windows. I should have used the free-trial first, now I'm stuck with it!"
341664,1.0,2018,"Love this program.  Virus protection OK, the parental controls are awesome.  I have had problems with my teen ADHD son sneaking on the computer and other things he wasn't supposed to.  He is very smart, also is very computer literate.  This software solved the problem in a matter of a couple of days.  You can track and remotely control all your kids computer, tablet and phone usage, all from your desktop.  You can control when and how much time total per week.  You can control which content is prohibited, or just monitored and recorded but the child is allowed to proceed.  Of course, shortly after the install he was online trying to find ways to defeat it, but it is easy to set up the software to see exactly what your kids have been doing.  My son had tried several things he thought were successful, but the Norton showed in Black and White exactly what he had been doing.  Confronted with the evidence, a powerful lesson was taught.  To other new users, make sure you keep track of not only all kids who may be on a device, but also all user accounts, real person or not."
341665,-1.0,2018,Works ok Ive had norton for years
341666,0.0,2018,"I bought it thinking I would be able to use the parental control features in my kids Chromebooks but this is not compatible with Chromebooks. I understand that the anti virus and malware features are not required in a Chromebook per say, but I was hoping to us its parental filtering and limit features. I wished their description would have mentioned that before I bought it."
341667,1.0,2018,Priced lower than buying direct from Norton.
341668,0.0,2018,"It seems to do a fine job of maintaining security across multiple devices.  However, it has an annoying habit of launching pop-ups trying to sell other products or services."
341669,1.0,2018,i aways loved having norton virus scan protection. just could not afford it. but now with this deal on 10 devices for the price of one it was a great deal. now everyone is covered.
341670,-1.0,2018,Very confusing
341672,1.0,2018,It works as expected.
341705,1.0,2018,"Love Norton, never had any issues"
341707,1.0,2018,Easy to download.  Great product.
341709,1.0,2018,"Better price than a renewal from Symantec even after they offered to lower the price.  It works very, very well"
341710,1.0,2018,I bought this from amazon.com website and please note that the product can ONLY be activated in USA or when connected to an USA server!. Outside USA it cannot be activated and so does not work. Once activated the program itself is working fine.
341711,1.0,2018,Great price!
341712,1.0,2018,It was just a described.
341713,1.0,2018,Good price and covers 10 devices.
341734,-1.0,2018,I purchased this with the supposed availability for 10 devices.  I activated it on one device and can't activate it on any other devices.  I get a message that the product key has already been activated.  This is ridiculous; the reason I bought it was for the multiple devices.
341735,-1.0,2018,"I redeem the code but every time I try to actual use the product does NOT WORK-TELLS ME IT HAS EXPIRED
- horrible / wasted all this money"
341736,-1.0,2018,I don't really care for this product. I was hoping for a much better product considering Norton had been around for a VERY long time. Norton does a good job of killing viruses and keeping your computer clean like it should (Hence the single star) but there are too many other interference's that I don't care for such as pop up's from within the software itself. This is quite annoying as I like virus software to run hidden in the background out of sight. I had Kaspersky before but heard about the US govt. stopping use of it due to potential spying. Wish I would have stayed with Kaspersky as it ran stealth in the background like it was supposed to do. Also Kaspersky had a very good ad blocker which Norton does not have. I won't buy Norton again when it's license expires due to these downfalls that it has. I expected much better from a brand name like Norton. :(
341737,1.0,2018,"I have been using Norton for more than 4 years and this is the best virus protection system in the market.
I allows you to use in four different computers."
341739,1.0,2018,"Great price, better than the box stores. 10 licenses to cover everything. Fast shipping"
341740,1.0,2018,Is good price but i know you can do much more better
341743,-1.0,2018,"This product didn't work as it was region locked, so I had to speak to Norton and pay extra to get the product activated."
341755,1.0,2018,"Every year I keep researching & discover Norton remains in the top 3 of ALL
security suites...and every year I keep saying I'm gonna try one of the other 2.

* but Norton makes the download so seamless & simple, even this old geezer can do it
* thus, I don't have to 'delete files' and then install a whole new set of security suite files
* Norton continually upgrades it's already user-friendly account/web page/app
* customer service is courteous, efficient, quick; AND they're willing to speak 'idiot grandpa'
* MOST IMPORTANTLY, Amazon consistently offers Premium/10 devices at rock-bottom sale price!!"
341756,1.0,2018,Great way to install security

I got so sick of it I was ready to uninstall Norton and did a Google search about the flood of advertising from Norton.  That is where I discovered that you can turn the advertising off in the settings.  Norton abuses their own customers to make another buck or two which is wrong.  Peter Norton has nothing to do with Norton Antivirus anyway and they just use his name for sales purpose, so I will go to something else when this expires."

344109,-1.0,2018,"Very unsettling user experience so far.  Just starting a project isn't as intuitive as on previous versions.  The dashed border around the text box doesn't disappear when you're done editing.  The graphics selection does not use a slider, but rather forward and fast-forward arrows, like something out of a children's game.  The specs specifically mention that projects saved on previous versions are not compatible.  Also, for being such a simple program, it is relatively sluggish.  As others have mentioned, it also installs adware (SmileBox) without warning or permission.  This last part really rubs me the wrong way.  Although I unistalled, the shortcut cannot be removed from the My Project page.  My copy of PS6 from 1997 worked on Vista and was a handy, no-frills go-to for 20 years.  Now, in 2018 with 64-bit everything and Windows 10 on a top-of-the-line PC, I pay for more software from a trusted company and get steaming garbage."

That is when things got weird. I tried to load Printshop 4 but ALL that was

Once I converted to Windows 10,  23.1 will not work dependably.  I read many poor reviews about 4.0, however, there are some positive ones so I decided I would try.  It is terrible. It would open 23.1 projects, as advertised, but they were distorted beyond use.  Attempts to print resulted in off-center, unacceptable results.  It is SLOW, doesn't open without several tries.  What a shame that such a good software product was allowed to become unusable. At first, I considered working with it for a longer period but just a short trial convinced me that it would be a waste of time and money.  I will return it.

For weeks I worked with their tech support (surprisingly, I got to speak to actual people), but we never got it to work.  And this was not a complex move, just going from a laptop with an SSD system drive and a hard drive for data to a laptop with a similar configuration.  And since transfers took about 8 hours over USB 3.0, I had to leave both laptops untouched for 8 hours, only to discover that the transfer had failed.  In the end, we were only able to get it to transfer the system drive, and that saved me from having to reinstall some programs.  But it would have taken much less time for me just to reinstall all the programs."

I was migrating from one 6 month old Win7 laptop to another new win 7 laptop, both the same make and model. There is no easier move than my situation.  What PCmover did using my wi-fi was move all program, (it took two times running the program) but what it did not do is migrate the license keys.  So MC programs were moved, but they would not run without the product key codes.  Some of my software is older, when I tried to manually enter the keys, it rejected it, so I went ahead and bought newer MS office versions.  PCmover did move my bookmarks, it did not move my outlook email, I had to rebuild all email accts.  While their tech support is ""free"", they didn't waste time telling me, that if I need more service it would cost $$. (they are based in East India, a little hard to understand) Tech support admitted I will have to enter the product keys on programs.  Acronis is worthless software, unless you are an IT rocket scientist, you'll not be able to get to second base using it. PC moverwill get you to 3rd base, but you'll still have to make your own way to home plate."

358129,-1.0,2018,"This software was extremely frustrating. What seemed initially easy quickly became a time consuming hassle lasting 3 days. The wireless transfer failed multiple times and 3 different failures with the external device method all resulting in ""Unhandled exception inside background thread. Please exit PCmover. I tried altering multiple settings, closing out the program and restarting in different attempts. When I finally managed to get the program to successfully export the PCmover file to transfer to my new computer, it would not copy onto my external hard drive. I then had to spend another day and a half trial and error attempting to get a version exported that  would not be so corrupted to be copied to my device. THEN, when I got the file unpacking onto my new computer, the transfer froze at 77% for 3 hours. I don't know exactly what is missing from that last 33%, but I ended up having to go file by file comparison with my old computer to check that major documents had transferred before just forcing the transfer to stop.
 I had not tried the cable transfer method option because I didn't want to give the company any more of my money for their special important cable, that they say is the only one you can use if you don't want to have files corrupted/lost.
Customer service/Customer support:
After the 1st day and half I contacted customer service to talk about returning the product because I was frustrated by the troubleshooting process and just was over it all. They said that it was policy that they could not refund or take a return without the customer first having customer support helping to remedy the problem. That was an irritating prospect as I knew if would involve more of what I was already doing but with a very long phone call with tech support. I was not looking forward to this. I opted for the chat option with tech support from the website, where I simply stated that I was all ready very over the wasted time and a bit frustrated that I was being required to contact them to try making it work. I knew it wan't the tech person's fault, so I stated this without being aggressive. They asked for the error message, but I hadn't screenshot it because it didn't indicate any error code that would specify a problem to research/fix. I mean, how vague is, ""unhandled exception inside background thread"" ?! I told them there was no error code and that it just said it was a general background error. I knew I had no choice, according to customer service, so I sent my anger to my place of zen and told the chat tech that I would have to go through the whole process to force it to fail to get the screenshot of the message for them. They told me to go ahead and do that. Then they sent me a link where I could have what appeared to be some outside contractor take control of my computer to make the program work. Now, this process would have meant a stranger had hold of my computer for hours, not 5-10 minutes I've experienced with major tech support departments for major industry software I worked with in my career. I was extremely suspicious of that option here, and in a Google search I found some reviews that confirmed my worries of this option resulting in major issues to the person's computer and continued failure of success. So, I ignored that option and had to suck it up for another day and half to make this bloody thing work enough to just transfer documents and media. I skipped the software transfer attempts, because that is what seemed to be causing the blasted error that stopped the creation of the file to transfer.
Now, I don't know what other programs are out there to easily move files from computer to computer, so I can't make a comparison. All I can say is that this was NOT easy, it was NOT efficient, and I was NOT happy with the program. Was I eventually partially successful? Yes, after days of being glued to my computers, manipulating and tweaking and all but performing a ritual sacrifice to the gods of the computer gremlins. So, I could only recommend this software to you if you had at least 3 days, immense patience for troubleshooting and technical knowledge, and possibly a weird pleasure associated with inflicting such mental torture onto yourself. Otherwise, I'd say you might be better off looking into other means of transferring you PC files to your new computer. Good luck."
358130,-1.0,2018,"Purchased a download to transfer files from my sister's old Dell (Windows 7) to new Dell (Windows 10). Setup went well -- screen directions are perfectly clear. Called the help line for a couple of questions before setup, got answers, and got started. Didn't have a USB cord and the only network was wifi so had to use that for the transfer, understanding it would take more time. Sunday morning: both machines looked like the software was working. Sunday night: old machine posted the message that it was done, look at new machine for status; new machine said it was still processing but said ""0 bytes processed."" This after 8 hours or so. Left the new machine running overnight and got the same message in the morning. Called PCmover help line several times on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning and got put on hold, then an offer to leave my name and phone number for a call back but then told ""our system is down."" Had to go to a tech help business to get the files transferred and he told me the software only works if both machines have the same operating system.

358132,-1.0,2018,"Software tries its best to transfer documents and programs, but fails to fulfill its advertised punch line. My experience with transferred programs is that programs that supposedly checked green do not work perfectly. Example, when opening a word document using Microsoft Office, every time Microsoft Office starts installing a missing component before opening document. I am very disappointed with this software to say the least."
358133,-1.0,2018,It did not work at all.
358134,-1.0,2018,"I usually pretty much depend on the reviews to select a product.  I needed to do what this product claimed to do. It went through the motions, but did not end up transferring one single item! Now I am out the cost of this piece of trash and still have to find software that will really do the job! Call me disgusted!"
358135,-1.0,2018,"Awful,  Moved login names and that was it.  Complete waste of money and 7 hours.

358411,-1.0,2018,It ran through the clone process then failed at the end. I would find another way.
358412,-1.0,2018,Doesn't work. Just flashes nit echo doesn't work on raid drives. I don't have any raid drives. Also this version is out of date. V. 3.5 is available. Just money thieves selling old product! Finally found v. 3.5. It works no better. Will go through the time to clone but clone still doesn't work. Tech support finally contacted me. Said they'd help me only if I would delete negative review. What an outrage!  I returned product and I'd like to help their support. Right out the door into the trash can. I know they will read this. I'd suggest they worry more about helping someone use their software rather than pull their 2nd grade tantrum and refuse to help. Thanks for nothing. I had my own hi-tech business for 25 years and would not have lasted a year if I behaved like these children.
358413,1.0,2018,"I have used Echo 3.5 to clone an HP WD Blue 1TB HD to as 1TB SanDisk SSD.
I was initially trying to boot to a SSD installed in a PCIe card. And I had difficulties.  I finally determined the PCIe would not work, and I tried to boot that same cloned copy via SATA... it failed and I was not a happy camper.  During these efforts I had a number of exchanges with NIi's support.  Even though I wrote one rather blunt (but courteous) email, Support continued to be helpful.  In the end, I did what Echo's advertisements say to do... I did a clean ""one to one"" clone, removed the original systems disk and booted to my SanDisk SSD, without any intervening efforts with the PCIe board.  It Worked.  JOY!  The software is EASY to use.  The process is pain free.
My problems were my own fault.
Stick with what they say... Clone and replace... it works!
I will continue to use Echo as my system recovery backup now that I have completed my move from HD to SSD."
358415,1.0,2018,Works perfectly when all the others we tried did not.  Great customer service +++++ They responded to 3 of our e-mails personally... even on a Sunday with helpful advice and information.

358418,-1.0,2018,"I should have known this Software had problems by the Amazon.com reviews.  It will not install on my Windows 10, Hewlett Packard computer.  I paid for Computer Experts to take over my computer to install this Software and it continued to fail.  The EXPERTS said the software corrupted my computer and I should call the software tech support for help.  The Software Tech Support is a bait-and-switch TYPE lie.  The Software Instructions provide a Tech telephone number, but when you call the phone number it only instructs you to HANG-UP and go to their Website, wherein the Website requires you to click the Support Tab, then it takes you to an email format which requires you to fill in your computer's technical details before you can even email your technical problem issue(s).  When I key in my software KEY CODE then press the ""NEXT"" tab to proceed, my computer cursor FREEZES-UP and LOCKS-UP my computer.  I still have not received any emails to address the software issues and who knows when I will.  YOU SHOULD READ THE AMAZON.COM REVIEWS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE ANY PRODUCTS.

5/9/2018  UPDATE:  These people Do NOT respond to my request for Installation Tech SUPPORT by EMAIL as they advertise.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT OR ANY OTHER PRODUCTS THEY MANUFACTURE.  READ ALL THE AMAZON REVIEWS.  BAD PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Read reviews how this product can corrupt your computer.  I have destroyed this CD.  It can only be used on (1) computer. Other clone products plug into all your computers and will clone for you."

We installed all our business applications and had been running it for 2-3 weeks when we decided to make a clone of the disk to use in case of drive failure. We bought Echo 3. Ran the install & registered it. When it wanted to reboot to start the cloning process, It took us to the screen continue or cancel. We hit continue. It failed to clone anything but the system restore partition onto the target drive. After going through many trials and errors with support, it was determined that the Boot partition of the source drive was deleted. NTI says their software couldn't have done it and blames it on a HDD failure, even though Drive 0 has data on the restore partition.,."
358421,1.0,2018,Simple easy to use or tweak as needed. Most cloning software I've tried didn't allow you to downsize if needed. For example auto resize partition to allow SSD that's smaller than original HD.
358422,-1.0,2018,"This a bad software, wiped out my HDD and cloned drive was useless...DO NOT Buy!! unless you just want to throw your money away.  Support sucks, no help at all.  Would not or could not answer questions, just gave up trying."

358424,1.0,2018,This is a product I would confidently recommend to any of my friends.  It is easy to use and performs it job flawlessly.  Definitely a 5 star product.
358425,1.0,2018,just what I expected works perfect doubt if there's a better product for the price.  EASY to setup and use for novices will ultimately save you big moolla from having to take to pc into a shop.  great product for all
358426,1.0,2018,Product did do exactly as expected and replaced a bad boot sector. User interface is a bit immature.
358427,-1.0,2018,"It failed to function at all. It is not the ""The Best Cloning Software"" as advertised. I had Echo tech support having me try different things to resolve the malfunction but nothing worked. I am very unhappy the product. I tried another company's cloning software which functioned flawlessly."
358428,-1.0,2018,"Here's what happened:  I bought this product, installed, registered,and updated online.  When the program runs, it checks if there is a multi-disk RAID array.  I have a simple Lenovo laptop with a single 256K solid state drive, so the program ran without RAID support (whatever that is).  Result is that my $1000 laptop now has a black screen and it cannot start.  I called NTI customer service and was told that this was a known issue and that the computer must be disassembled and the solid state drive must be replaced.  NTI also said they only provide email support in about two business days.  Since this is my primary business computer, I sent it for immediate repairs.  Still waiting for an email from NTI tech support...

Before buying this product, you should consider the many reviews that report this same issue.  To protect customers from a harmful product, maybe this item should be removed from Amazon.  What do you think?"

You may clone more than once from one  computer but how many people have more than one computer that is alike.  Other than that snag the software actually works very well and easy to use. nti should make it in their description of the product that is for one product only."
358437,1.0,2018,"The only thing I do not like is that unlike Macrium Reflect, you must reboot for this software to clone the drive."

358583,1.0,2018,"Its really an essential antivirus program, keeps a lot of online troubles away. Kudos to the Avast team for such development!  The tools within this program make it even more secure."

358589,-1.0,2018,"The free version isn't worth it. The constant popups and ads are as annoying as an actual virus. I switched to another antivirus, and it was like using AdBlock Plus for the first time.

Edit: I tried replying to the comment below by Avast, but I got an error message, so here's my reply: I have no reason to financially support a company that intentionally makes its free software so intrusive and aggressively distracting."

358597,1.0,2018,Very nice product. It help me tremendously. Thank you.
358598,-1.0,2018,"WAY too many annoying popups, but I guess that's what you get with a free version. There's a way to make the popups last for less time (as little as 1 second before it disappears) but you can only apply it to certain types of popups. Ads and various other popups stay until you click the X."

358603,-1.0,2018,"I wish I could put zero stars. I do not want this and want to get rid of it. Removing it from my computer, I'm afraid will not be enough. They want to charge me for it later. I'm trying to return this. Don't be fooled by the zero cost. They will charge way more later."
358604,1.0,2018,This Antivirus is free and does what it is supposed to do.
358605,1.0,2018,Best Ive had yet! Catches everything on my computer.
358606,-1.0,2018,Did not block all problems
358607,1.0,2018,Only kept it a couple weeks as I don't really feel comfortable with free anti virus programs. Uninstalled when I received my paid version of my usual product but must say that while I had it installed there were no problems. So if you can't find a program that you want to pay for this would probably be fine.
358609,-1.0,2018,Did not get.
358611,0.0,2018,Did not really like it

358621,1.0,2018,I have been using this for a while it's amazing
358622,1.0,2018,Fantastic product.
358623,1.0,2018,"As far as protection goes, Avast does a fine job without bogging down your system.  I give it high marks for those two things.

What is a bit annoying is that it is constantly putting up ""scare notices"" about all sorts of things (everyone can see what you do online, you don't have a firewall, the snow is melting in the arctic, an asteroid will crash into your browser, the air in your room is toxic, etc etc etc) to try and get you to subscribe to the paid version of the software.

I understand that they need to monetize their product (businesses definitely should pay for the product).  I really do...  But perhaps tone down the frequency the scare notices a tad?

I still do recommend Avast, and regularly install it on client's computers when I see they have no protection."
358624,1.0,2018,"Used this for years because it was free and fast on Win9x, so I might be more experienced than most users. They have thrown in a lot of annoying ads for their own product, those kind where you have to read the screen to not buy an upgrade. So no different than McAfee or the other guys, Avast will lock up the PC for a small time (not as bad as McAfee) when launching new programs that it hasn't seen before, sometimes it tells you it's doing it, sometimes it says it won't run it unless you click something, sometimes it offers to upload a sample to HQ.

The screens are OK for me, it's the price you pay (I have paid some years, usually when I'm cleaning up a friend's PC I make them buy a year to start), and if you can afford $19/yr or whatever some of the costs are please support these guys since they offer a free version."
358625,0.0,2018,I don't think Advast is as good as Advertised.
358626,-1.0,2018,mine did not run.
358627,-1.0,2018,Didn't run at all...

358631,1.0,2018,This does what it needs to do! Thank you!!

358633,1.0,2018,keep my pc up to date and running good
358634,0.0,2018,so many pop up ads from avast themselves
358635,1.0,2018,The free avast works well and seems to be trust worthy but they do bombard you with new versions that are not free and I would buy them but they are monthly and they want your credit card number. Once you start that its hard to stop it if you want.
358636,1.0,2018,the best
358637,0.0,2018,mine is not updated and I worry that I still have malware on my laptop.

358640,1.0,2018,have used the free program for a number of years - it's gone from the best to the 'bestest' in my opinion and I've tried them all - if I begin to make more purchases online I will definitely upgrade to get those premium coverages
358641,1.0,2018,Good basic protection w/o a charge. Appreciate that..
358642,1.0,2018,great system. have used it for over 10 years now!
358643,1.0,2018,Simple and effective.
358644,0.0,2018,It seems to offer good protection and my computer has really slowed since I started using it.
358645,1.0,2018,"I have used Avast for many years now and always the free version and I have never had any trouble with it.
I have paid for AntiVirus products and had them freeze up, pop up in the middle of an online document
for work, etc., I recommend AVAST for both work and personal use."
358646,1.0,2018,You Get A Lot For Free. Good Protection Too
358647,1.0,2018,Avast is lean and does not slow down my computer. I have recommended Avast to everyone I know who owns a computer
358648,1.0,2018,"It's a great program to catch the day to day viruses and malware that lay in wait. It's also great that it is still free after all these years. I have actually recommended it to many. The only downside is that it's nag notices have gotten kind of deceptive as of late & have tricked some people I know into subscribing to their pay service. When you install it, it also tries to install various system junk that is pretty useless unless you're a paying subscriber. Other than that, it's still better than AVG & the like for the day to day protection."
358649,1.0,2018,I've been using avast for years now and it has never failed me. It stops viruses dead in their track before they can download onto your computer or smart device. Thanks Avast!
358650,1.0,2018,very handy
358651,-1.0,2018,I hate the constant pop-ups. Avast used to be much better without them.
358652,1.0,2018,I feel very confident that I am well protected.
358653,1.0,2018,"It is free, it does the job"
358654,1.0,2018,"What's not to like about cost-free, reliable protection?"
358655,1.0,2018,"This is an excellent product. I have been using it for  over a year now and it really does removes viruses, prevents viruses and help increase computer speed. It also notifies you when its time resolve certain issues on your computer. LOVE IT!"

358663,1.0,2018,Got this for my wifes tablet. Works great and gives her peace of mind.
358665,-1.0,2018,"The free antivirus was okay until I was nagged to do a $25 upgrade, at which point my Windows 10 OS locked up.  Complaining to their Facebook site proved futile as the recommendation to download an uninstall utility could not be don since I was locked out.  I requested they send their uninstall utility by mail so I could download it to a flash drive but was ignored.  I think this upgrade is ransom ware, designed to hold your OS hostage so you will spend more to fix a problem AVAST created.  Beware."
358666,-1.0,2018,This free antivirus download is a gimmick. It doesn't provide any service unless you pay for an upgrade.
358667,1.0,2018,Best ever!  Certainly better scores in detection in the certification labs than the antivirus from Microsoft
358669,1.0,2018,So far so good
358670,1.0,2018,Free
358671,1.0,2018,Product has stopped several bad files from opening from internet.  I appreciate the protection it provides.

358674,-1.0,2018,WOULD NOT DOWNLOAD
358676,-1.0,2018,"Don't use it!!! I installed on my computer and caused major issues. My computer got full of junk and super slow. I uninstalled Avast, but that didn't fix the issues, so I had to buy McAfee and they cleaned up all their mess. Then, I found a charge of $50 on my bank statement because my free services with Avast had expired. I am disputing the fee. Horrible experience!!!"
358677,0.0,2018,"I got it because I needed an antiviral program
and couldn't afford a mcafee at the time.
Since I got a years worth of protection...
Ill stay with this 1 BUT most likley won't be buyin again IF I can help it...
Reason bein that I don't like bein spammed with offers to upgrade
for a given price just by runnin a normal scan."
358678,1.0,2018,So far has worked great!
358679,1.0,2018,Works
358680,-1.0,2018,"This garbage installed itself on my pc without my permission. I have a masters degree in engineering in case you don't think I know what I'm talking about. I think that CCleaner installed it on its last update. Pinform which owns Avast recently bought CCleaner, so that explains the motivation.

This is essentially a virus. Keep far away if you value your time. It's also not easy to uninstall. Get ready to learn how to put your PC into safe mode and waste 15 minutes uninstalling this crap."
358681,1.0,2018,I figured out I had to download it myself and not through Amazon
358682,1.0,2018,Great

Pros: It's free. It has slightly has better detection rate compare to Microsoft Essential."
359530,1.0,2018,The Avast site is extremely easy to understand with clear explanations of what I need to do in the way of updates and choices regarding services. Quickly resolves issues found and we've been very pleased.
359531,1.0,2018,always propmpts to update and cleans up to save space and make computer faster
359532,-1.0,2018,"Purchased it, installed it. and it has only been maybe two months and it says that I need to pay for another year already !!!!!!  Don't make the purchase."

359535,-1.0,2018,This is advertised as a one year security but that is not accurate. it is only 30 days

359601,-1.0,2018,I can't figure how to get activation code from avast or Amazon. I have  down load the program again from amazon. To get updates from  avast. They also bombard with upgrade crap.
359602,1.0,2018,This software does a good job of protecting my PC (I have not had any issues since I started using it 2 yrs ago) and is reasonably priced.
359603,-1.0,2018,A 30 day trial the hell is this... I WANT A REFUND
359604,1.0,2018,Best way to protect myself.

359608,1.0,2018,"I like Avast. I've been using it for over 10 years and have no complant, except that it has become contaminated with constant pop-up adds. No matter what program one is using, pop-up adds for more features at more cost, continue to irratate. I recently upgraded to Pro Antivirus in the hope of getting rid of the pop-ups but they have not stopped. Now I find that the extra features I thought I would get with the upgrade still cost even more and are not included in the Pro version. I believe I may cancel the Pro upgrade and look for an add free Virus program."
359609,1.0,2018,Great protection for the price.  Works well at identifying and containing threats.
359610,1.0,2018,Hey it's without ads. Ave uts an antivirus why complain about Anything else
359611,-1.0,2018,"The software loaded easily and ran well for one month. Then it stopped working and when I phoned Avast to help fix the problem, they said they would fix it for $99.95USD. With another software experts advice I removed it completely from my computer and installed Microsoft Security Essentials which completely protects your computer. My OS is windows7 and I looked at some YouTube videos on how to speed my 7 year old computer up, cleaned it up and I cant believe how fast its running. I was carrying 92 Gb of windows backup files which I deleted and now my computer is lightning quick. Dump Avast, its a scam."
359612,-1.0,2018,"With 234 days left in my subscription with this produce, I have decided to DELETE it from my computer.  Enough is Enough!
This software product is marketed as ""Premier"" but its really not a bundled WHOLE security package.  It is the standard antivirus program with maybe a firewall but I KEEP GETTING ADS to activate additional features that should have come STANDARD with a ""Premier"" package.
If I purchase a Cadillac car, I expect it to not only be a complete car with tires wheels and a motor but have bells and whistles too, It shouldnt need me to buy the doors and windows extra!  Premier is basic antivirus and firewall.  Im not even sure the firewall is any better than the windows firewall.
It wants to add on the password saver, the system driver scanner, the update checkers, and the additional system type speedup and registry cleanup stuff as all add on purchases. After you add on all those additional purchases its more expensive than my last bundled security software. I wish I could return this go back the McAfee for all the advertisements this ""Premier"" has been giving me.  I hope your listening avast. cause without some type of change in your marketing strategy, your going to piss off enough customers that by word of mouth alone its going to cost you business."
359712,1.0,2018,Works well.  Haven't run into any dislikes.
359713,1.0,2018,"Typsey is great because the program gives you tons and tons of opportunities for practice.
Most other online programs only seem to give you a few.  I do have suggestions that would make it infinitely more useful for the visually impaired though. They need to offer more fonts and chances to alter the colors in the games. There are lots of games but right now they are unusable for me because I can't tailor them to my needs. I can use the other training sections though and they are great. With a few changes this program could be excellent."
359714,1.0,2018,"Bought this software for my mother, she enjoys it and says it is great for her typing. Definitely recommend."
359715,1.0,2018,Its a good program that offers a good course to learn home row.

360462,-1.0,2018,Did not work.
360463,1.0,2018,"Yes, it works. I was hesitating about buying, but Im glad I did. Purchase reason: I replaced the hard drive on my laptop with a solid state drive. I needed to install windows 7 operating system and this dvd did the trick . Just make sure you have an activation key for windows. Its obviously not included. I found this key on a label under my laptop. Last thing, make sure you read and follow instructions provided with this dvd, otherwise the installation will be confusing."

361274,-1.0,2018,"Never even used it.  The first time I just opened it up to hit some buttons and test function.  Then I closed it and get pop-ups!!!
I consider this program bloatware & full of ads and they want input all the time.  Not here to help you design it.  Pass on it.
(sorry no photos, I uninstalled that fast)"
361476,1.0,2018,Used for general word processing an record keeping. Made my projects a snap. Fast delivery
361478,-1.0,2018,"Cannot get this program to load. Disk is not recognized by my computer. Cannot return it to seller. Thought there was some thing to out do Microsoft,  guess not. Wasted my money.  Did Microsoft put a deamon in it?"
361480,1.0,2018,Excellent.  Superior to Microsoft.  I have used Word Perfect from the early development days.
361481,-1.0,2018,"Quattro Pro X8 portion of the Suite will not recognize any printer on my system.  I have been in contact with Corel tech support (worst I have ever experienced in my 71 years on this planet). All kinds of apologies,but no results. Support by email (what a dumb idea). I have been using WordPerfect for years, but am more than disappointed with this product.  Their main fix was for me to buy a different version of their junk program. I have many spreadsheets which are now functionally worthless."
361483,1.0,2018,works well
361485,1.0,2018,"Corel's word perfect works so much easier than the other system I was paying for and it does not have to be re-purchased each year.  It also does not keep changing constantly, without getting easier to use."
361489,1.0,2018,So far great.
361490,1.0,2018,"I've always loved WordPerfect, and prefer it over Microsoft Word. However, it's not compatible with my Libre Office files I created (freeware), so that's disappointing..."
361491,1.0,2018,"This version enables me to make a PDF without selecting the document first.  In WP6, it would only do the first page.  WP6 would frequently crash on me while I was in a document.  I was hoping this wouldn't do it, but it has.  But I've used WP since it first came out in the 80's, and I'll continue to do so.  I also see no reason to buy the Standard version when this fine for most people and is far cheaper.  It's a fine program, and I hope they continue to make it!  Don't know if others have had the crashing issue.  Now I frequently hit Control S while working in a document."
361492,1.0,2018,I have been using sord perfect forever and this upgrade was wonderful to work with microsoft word as well  very interchangeable
361493,1.0,2018,"I've been using a word processor since the 1980s.  First it was WordStar, then XYWrite, the latter being a superb word processor.  And as that faded away, WordPerfect.  Which I liked.  About 15 years ago a friend mocked me for using WordPerfect and chided me to use Microsoft Word, the ""standard"".  I succumbed in my shame, and I thought WordPerfect had since vanished, gone under against the tide of the behemoth, Microsoft.
Over the years I found myself using a word processor less and less.  MS Word was just too clumsy, bulky, slow.  It couldn't keep up with my thoughts.  It had too many complicated options, too many bells and whistles.  It seemed as though it was written not by a writer, but by a software engineer, going on theory in what he thought writers needed.
Furthermore, it was being charged by the month in their Office 365.  I felt chagrin at being charged monthly for a substandard service.  Greedy MS.
Last year, in my desperation, I began using just simple Notepad for my writings.

Then I discovered WordPerfect was still around.  And for a measly $60, a one off payment, no more renting, I owned it, forever, nothing more to pay.  Bliss when I started using WordPerfect again.  A decade and a half lost.
All because of greedy Mr G.
WordPerfect, for me is the perfect combination of being simple, yet powerful.  And fast.
I'm loving writing now.  I have the perfect tool back again.
Thank you WordPerfect for surviving the behemoth, monolithic MS, and being still available to writers like me.
Shame on you, MS, for the destructiveness of your business practices in forcing out superior competing products."
361495,-1.0,2018,this program is extreme buggy
361496,1.0,2018,GOOD
361497,1.0,2018,Great price for this software!
361498,1.0,2018,"I mostly bought this for the WordPerfect program to update from X5 because I couldn't read other newer files with it.  On the other hand, I wish Quattro Pro could handle the spreadsheet formulas that I used in Lotus 123 so I could use it instead of needing to install LibreOffice just for its spreadsheet program.  There are a few functions that no one else has added to their spreadsheets (except LibreOffice and OpenOffice) and I have to write my own macros to make my own functions (SUMIF is one example of the old functions that Excel and others didn't have when I tried them).  The thing I like best about WordPerfect is the reveal codes feature;  other programs drive me crazy when I'm trying to change something in the document and I can't because it keeps selecting the wrong areas to apply an attribute.  WordPerfect was also the only program that could handle my thesis when I was still in college in the 90's."
361499,0.0,2018,A BIT MORE COMPLICATED THAN EXPECTED
361500,-1.0,2018,Office X8 will not load on to windows 10..... they are incompatible so buyer beware Corel is not telling people this. I found out from reliable computer people that x8 will work on w10 after windows defender is tweaked a bit but please don't rely on corel support staff to help cause they don't know diddle about this issue. Beware of corel support staff find a reliable computer expert to help you out. Pluss if you send this software because it aint working you will get nothing back as a refund.
361501,-1.0,2018,"I've been using WordPerfect for many years, without any significant problem, but this one is the worst ever (details too many to list here).  My contacts with the seller were basically a waste of my time.  I finally decided to remove WordPerfect Office X8 from my computer and reinstalled an older version (X5)."
361502,1.0,2018,"OK, but I still miss the good old days with a manual."
361503,0.0,2018,"I've been a WordPerfect user and huge fan for over 20 years . . .  until now.  I love the program because I find it's much more user-friendly than Word, and I love the reveal codes feature.  I love that I can easily customize the tool bar at the top to have the features that I use most.

I bought a new computer and needed an updated version of WordPerfect as the one I had was not compatible any longer.  The problem with this one is that I need to be able to convert between WordPerfect and Word easily because I only have access to Word at work.  I was not able to save my documents in Word like I used to be able to even though I read plenty of reviews that said it converts easily.  I got an error message.

I tried contacting customer service.  I was told that they do not provide support through chats or phone - only through email.  The representative I had sent emails back and forth for weeks suggesting different things - none of which worked.  It was extremely frustrating.  I kept asking for someone to work with me via chat or phone to resolve the problem.  Those requests were ignored.  I finally called again to find that it is possible to schedule a call for help, but they would not give me a different rep than the one I had been emailing for weeks with no success.  He was rude and not at all helpful.  It was the worst customer service experience I've had that I can remember (though GoPro is close).

If you can use only this program, it is a great program.  If you need to convert back and forth with MS Word and may need help, don't bother."
361505,-1.0,2018,They put pop-ups in that cannot be shut off.  I contacted tech and they can't or won't tell you how to turn off the pop-ups.  The pop-ups keep telling you to UPGRADE.  Don't buy this until they stop the pop-ups.
361506,1.0,2018,Works great WITHOUT the HIGH PRICED MS version
361507,1.0,2018,"We have always loved WordPerfect Office. It beats Microsoft Office Word by a mile!

361510,0.0,2018,"Most=reveal codes.  Least=everything else especially the fact that WP inconsistently opens a new WP program instead of an old document in the current open program.  When I press ""window,"" it doesn't show what's open.  Every time I close a document, I get a blank page.  If you fix these problems, I'll tell you more.  It's very frustrating.  If it didn't have ""reveal codes,"" I would switch to Microsoft Word."
361511,1.0,2018,Very fast delivery. WordPerfect ist still one of the best programs to work with texts.
361512,-1.0,2018,Can't load because there is no serial number. If I can't get one I Will send it back

361520,1.0,2018,"I have used WordPerfect for more years than I care to admit - from the very first version ever put out.  It is far superior to Microsoft and has many, many more applications and is much easier to use.  I am buying this today to upgrade for Windows 10.  I will update this review when I get it installed.  I do not anticipate any difficulties, as WP has always, always been dependable and their support has lways been excellent."
361735,1.0,2018,"Worked exactly as promised, came with very helpful instructions. Excellent!"
361736,-1.0,2018,too hard to understand

361738,-1.0,2018,"I purchased this windows 8.1 recovery disk some months ago. Is was advertised as a recovery DVD for also windows 8.1 with bing. I previously contacted the seller because Windows 8.1 with bing was not an option when I attempted to do the re-install. I was told to select ""auto select"" and it would install and automatically work. It seems to work well for the first few months but recently I noticed a message on my computer saying that my subscription for Windows will be expired in September and I need to activate it now. I tried to enter my windows 8.1 with bing KEY but  its not activating. I really don't want to reinstall Windows again as I have alot of important programs installed on my computer. I sent another email to the supplier a few days ago but i haven't received a response as yet. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you"
361739,1.0,2018,"Worked as advertised, very simple to install and use. I really was quite surprised that it worked, as I'm not computer savvy. I loaded it on a brand new hard drive and it worked like a charm!"

361744,1.0,2018,"Works like a charm! Easy set-ups. My windows 10 stopped working with a lot of errors but after using this recovery disc, I installed windows 8.1 easy breezy and now my laptop runs way better."

361755,1.0,2018,"Worked as expected!  I thought I'd been scammed at first, because I couldn't get my laptop to run the disc while in the windows recovery.  You have to power the laptop on first, and make an exception in Windows firewall.  Next, this is really important- double click the disc's icon in My Computer.  A window will come up with one option being ""Retrieve my Windows OEM Security Key.""  DO NOT BEGIN installing your OS without writing this down you will be locked out after installation!!!!  Restart your laptop, tap F8 to enter recovery mode.  Begin installing Windows 8.1 OS and wipe out all previous partitions till you see ""Only unallocated space left"".  Enjoy Windows 8.1 !!!!!"
361757,-1.0,2018,Make sure you have the original windows box or you will have to write and get a number from fast and wait for it. Dosr not just load you have to answer questions. My advice; save time and find a computer wizard.
361758,1.0,2018,Works great.
361759,1.0,2018,Very effective in restoring my windows laptop.  Easy to use - with complete instructions.

361763,1.0,2018,worked like a charm!
361855,1.0,2018,Love it. Prefer it over Word. I particularly like the reveal codes function.
361856,-1.0,2018,No refund for a buggy software program.  This unacceptable. It cost basically nothing to send a download and no refund.  Constant printing issues that need a professional software programmer to fix. DO NOT buy this for Windows 7!
361858,-1.0,2018,would not install right and doesn't work. won't even remove its self
361860,1.0,2018,I've always used Word Perfect since I got my first Amiga long ago.  I would not change to Word for a moment.

361864,-1.0,2018,Sadly it does not work with my computers format.  Even had my IT department try and open it after it was downloaded.
361865,1.0,2018,"It installed easily, and I almost can't tell the difference in function, just higher quality, than Word Perfect X5 that I had been using."
361866,-1.0,2018,"Beware of this download - it will not download on a windows 10 Acer Laptop.  The directions for installing are not good - they tell us they are proving a user code, but none occurs.  Plus, you are stuck if the program doesn't download - you will not get your money back - very poor on Amazon's part.  As a Prime subscriber and generally happy with Amazon, this is not good public relations if you cannot get your money back if a program does not down load on your computer."
361964,1.0,2018,"I like this version of Linux but some of the programs lack some of the detailed functions of Windows.
For example; when you download a file or picture and need to put it into a new directory, you can't, you have to open the file manager and navigate to the directory that you want to make a subdirectory in then go back and move the downloaded file out of the download directory and into the new directory, It's a pain."

Had same issue with usb. Finally purchased a dvd 14.04 which loaded, only issue now is getting Libre Office to work (am painstakeningly slowly getting some Libre Office to work)."
362078,1.0,2018,Works well and generally easy to use. Would I like to see improvements yes but then everyone what it to meet their criteria.
362079,1.0,2018,Very accurate and affordable
362080,1.0,2018,Easy setup!  Love the features with it. I just got it in today I might have to come back to update later. I know this much it's has better features compare to the vyncs GPS. It worth paying the monthly fee
362081,1.0,2018,"Great product that gives you a ton of detail, well worth the money; and it is better then the previous two similar products I have purchased"
362124,1.0,2018,"This is an amazing program. I upgraded from the pro version to ex becuase I wanted to work on a book of mine. I didn't even need to install the whole software all i had to do is change the lic code to the ex version and register it and it added all the ex attachments. Didnt have to rearrange my preferences either everything stayed the same which is a plus. I highly recommand thia program for novice's and pros a like. Very user friendly its defintaly a great startinf point for digital artists. I waited for the ex version to go on sale but its worth every penny. If you want to start with pro version I highly recommend that as well. Very affordable, very user friendly, very fun. I could not ask for more. I attached a few illustrations I did with this program."
362125,1.0,2018,"This although is not as filled as photoshop in functionality, for sketching, and simple drafting is my new go-to programme."
362127,1.0,2018,Amazing program! Even though I'm a beginner I can really tell that I'm getting a whole lot for what I paid! This program is jam packed with features and options for you to create to your hearts content!
362128,1.0,2018,"Works great with my UGEE graphics tablet monitor. I am enjoying trying all of the drawing tools and playing around with rotoscoping video footage with this program.

I would recommend this program for those wanting to create digital art and animations without paying out big bucks for Adobe's products or fiddling around with the cumbersome (but free GiMP program)."
362129,1.0,2018,"The best program for anime, comics, illustrations and manga."
362130,1.0,2018,Got it for my daughter. She absolutely loves it.
362131,1.0,2018,"I'm a freelance comic artist who's used Photoshop for ages.  A fellow artist friend of mine put me on Clip Studio Paint a year or so ago but I hesitated on getting it.  I was content on using Photoshop since I was so familiar with it.  Recently I decided to purchase CSP since it was on sale and I saw a number of artists that I follow start using it.  I wish I just pulled the trigger when I first heard of it.  I find it more tailored to illustrators than PS.  Not much of a learning curve either.  PS functions translate over to CSP easily.  The EX version has more functions that I probably need, but I couldn't pass up the sale for all the bells and whistles.  I'm more of a traditional ink and paper illustrator and only coloring digitally.  But with Clip Studio Paint, I've started doing full digital illustrations.  As an artist, I highly recommend."
362132,1.0,2018,"This program is superb for illustrating comics and making digital art. It takes some getting used to because it's different than Photoshop, but it's well worth it. It has features that Photoshop lacks for Illustrating, such as the stabilizer and screen tones, making it much better to work with. The only thing I don't love is that the painting function is much more like real paint than Photoshop painting, so it's easy to get colors all muddy if you don't know what you're doing. Over all, though, it's a great program to work with."
362133,1.0,2018,"Very easy to use. Would give it 5* as just an illustration programme. The animation side of it is
very good but not the best so ive given it a 4*."
362134,1.0,2018,Teenage daughter loves it!!
362135,1.0,2018,"I have tried MANY MANY art programs and this is by far the BEST one. Its responsive and does not lag or suddenly shut down out of nowhere.
I would definitely recommend this program."
362136,1.0,2018,Much better than the Pro program. Well worth the money to get the EX from the beginning.  Excellent product (program)
362138,1.0,2018,"I have used a couple of drawing softwares before and this one is great for the price if you get it when it's on discount (is on discount quite often), it's still pretty nice even without the discount to be honest. But please note if you only need to draw get the paint version, if you want to animate/draw manga and want many other features get THIS, if you want to edit photos this is not the software for you. Oh yeah and by the way you only need the serial number after getting this product, the disk is pretty useless."
362174,1.0,2018,Works great. Software install successfully
362175,0.0,2018,Looks like they send you an outdated version. Much better to just download the software from the Clip Studio site. You will get the latest version there.
362176,1.0,2018,Very basic but good!
362177,0.0,2018,"This is a powerful program at a great price. HOWEVER: the disk I purchased will no longer install as I get a ""catastrophic"" error message and nothing else. I downloaded the trial version from the CELSYS website and it did install. HOWEVER when the program starts and shows up in task manager as running, THERE IS NO INTERFACE SHOWING SO I CANNOT USE TE PROGRAM. In working with CELSYS to resolve the issue I apparently must create a whole new admin account and to do that I must also create a new Microsoft Account. On top of that, Microsoft's website opened via Windows 10 Settings will not even allow me to create a Microsoft account giving the error: ""something went wrong"" and that is it. I am left stranded having paid for a program that will not even show an interface!

UPDATE: Celsys provided a work around for this issue. After disconnecting from the internet I was allowed by Windows 10 to create another account without registering with Microsoft. The proge\ram now works but I am forced to use it only in the second account. This is very irritating and inconvenient. SoI changed my rating from a 1 star o a three star. I would rate it higher but this program does not export in svg format."
362178,1.0,2018,"Great software. I bought these and one of the Wacom drawing tablets, thinking myself an artist. I overestimated my abilities, but that's not the programs fault. It has all the tools you need to draw comic-book style characters and isn't that hard to pick up. There's also plenty of brushes and tutorials available all over the internet."
362179,1.0,2018,"This is about the paint program itself, I don't use the studio that is online based. Love this software. There are lots of tutorials online and a manual to download. Once you get used to the ""sub menus"" which is where you can customize brushes, etc., your options are open. I'm learning to use the 3D models to make my figure drawings more correct. Keep with it. If you get exasperated, do something else for awhile. I use a cheap graphics board that I also bought from Amazon with it. And yes, it can save to psd format. I have Artflow on my phone and i can use the psd layers in both programs, a few things such as colors may be a bit different.

However, to get the most out of it you DO need to get online for a few downloads. Seems all the companies are doing this.

Get it and Create!"
362180,1.0,2018,Great drawing program for the price. Of course you can't expect Photoshop level of editing but this is not a photo manipulation program. I love the texture that comes with the program but you can use your own too and it's pretty versatile. This is basically like Paint Tool Sai and really similar in interface. Easy to learn and lots of tutorials out there too for those of you who wants to learn extensively.
362181,1.0,2018,"Love this program, prefer it over photoshop in every way"
362182,1.0,2018,It's a great software for illustrations. I love it!
362183,0.0,2018,Can't really say one way or the other since the drawing board does not work at all.
362184,1.0,2018,"I can't recommend this product enough. I bought this when it was Manga Studio 5 (they stopped updating MS5 and offered free upgrades to CSP so I took the upgrade) and it's even better than the other name of the product. It has beautiful sensitivity with my Wacom, the export and import of most files from other programs (such as imports a PSD file), with brushes you don't really need to mess with due to the fantastic presets. I've included some the pieces I've made from the past 2 years with this product."
362185,1.0,2018,"Quick and easy to use, I just got my first graphics tablet to use with this and I have found everything in clip studio easy to figure out and ness around with."
362186,1.0,2018,good program to draw in
362187,1.0,2018,"Amazing program, so much better than Photoshop! At least from the perspective of an artist application. Better pens, better brushes, better features! Wish I would have started out with this software. Very happy with the purchase. My only complaint is that I wish I would have bought the EX version so I would have unlimited frames of animation. It was only a 40$ difference at the time and would have been well with it. But for a comic and/or illustration software, I don't think Clio Studio can be beat! Works great with a digital tablet as well. Photoshop gave me issues, thought it was my tablet or driver but nope, just the program!"
362188,1.0,2018,My daughter enjoys using this with her drawing tablet.
362189,1.0,2018,"works great, can be updated to latest version"
362190,1.0,2018,Love this program! I originally wanted Photoshop but couldn't afford it. This was perfect what I needed it for. I just wished it had vector illustration.
362191,-1.0,2018,Program glitches and stalls.  Very difficult to use without training.  Wish I could return.
362194,1.0,2018,"Purchased for my daughter, she had drawn an anime girl and had her hair animated and flowing in less than an hour... it must have a pretty good UI, as she never asked me for help or seemed frustrated or confused."
362195,1.0,2018,excellent software. A good alternative to photoshop especially for beginners to digital arts.  It's like photoshop's little sister that could.
362196,1.0,2018,"I don't use a lot of the advanced features, but of what I do use, layers, and the pends and brushes and transform tools and such, I find the interface to be intuitive. I have used photo shop and gimp in the past, and I like this program the best. I took a tutorial on it previously, so I was ready to start using it when it arrived. One of the nice features is the vector lines. I don't believe Gimp has this feature. Also, I was able to get to creating pretty quickly and the GUI is well laid out. I think for the few dollars this costs compared to gimp, which is free, this is worth the money because of its ease of use."
362197,1.0,2018,love it
362198,1.0,2018,A very nice software for a beginner.
362199,-1.0,2018,Well....most computers do not have physical disk drives anymore and MOST companies allow you to download a trial software download then you simply punch in your serial number and you are good to go....Well...Not THIS software. Sent it back.

362208,1.0,2018,I love this program. So versatile and easy to use. Plenty of different brushes.
362209,1.0,2018,"Got it for my daughter, she loves it and says it is a very very good piece of software."
362210,1.0,2018,"Wow! This program is AMAZING. I know that there are already tons of reviews out there saying this already, but having now used it a few times myself-- i totally get it. I'm a purest when it comes to art, having always done my art work by the traditional physical means, so stepping into this digital realm is definitely WAY outside of my comfort zone. With that said, I don't think i could have chosen a better program to do that with. It's like having an entire art studio at your finger tips, literally. Again, Wow!"
362211,1.0,2018,"Great, but had to return it because of my granddaughter's computer, otherwise fine, no problems with return at all."

Unless you're a professional, this somewhat feature reduced version is adequate for most everyone. There is a steep learning curve with all these types of programs, but Corel has provided a very good help section.  My go-to place for help though, is you tube. Every feature of Corel is explained by several different people, and in many varying languages too.  There's no way I can learn everything about this program, seems like there is an infinite number of things you can do with it, but it is so much fun, I keep trying to learn more."

364533,-1.0,2018,"I've been using CorelDraw for years, sometimes professionally, sometimes for personal projects -- it's been a great product. When I upgraded to Windows 10, my older version of CorelDraw wouldn't function anymore, and the fix was to upgrade to the latest version. So I did. I used it for a bit, but there were some bugs, in particular the ""snap to grid"" functionality was flaky. I figured ""snap to grid is one of the the most basic things that drawing software does, so there must be a patch for this"". I looked, and sure enough, CorelDraw X8 has had multiple patch updates. BUT, they  don't apply to the Home & Student version. AND CorelDraw hasn't released any patches for Home & Student version. So I contacted customer support, and they said basically ""we never said we'd provide updates, so go away"" I pointed out that the comparison matrix they provide online doesn't list patch availability as a difference between Home and Student and the standard edition, and they said ""So what? The comparison doesn't count. Go away."" So, having wasted money and time on this nonsense, I've moved on to Inkscape -- not as fancy, but no bugs in screaming bugs in its basic functionality, and it's FREE!"
364534,0.0,2018,"This is the best, smoothest version of Corel I've used, BUT... Corel Font Manager has been left out of H&S, making adding/deleting fonts a real bear. I still can't figure out how to delete/hide them, especially the voluminous MS foreign-language fonts which I've stripped out of Win 10 Pro.

The very comprehensive 765-page User Guide is for the full version, without any distinction between it and H&S (every instruction has ""This may not work in H&S,"" which is no help at all. I feel sorry for users new to CorelDRAW).

I don't understand these oversights; a person new to CD isn't going to buy the full suite if H&S is so frustrating to use. Online Help and Community Help are as useless as ever, a Corel tradition."
364535,0.0,2018,Not bad if you need Corel Draw. It tents to crach on a daily basis when my printer dialog box pops up. Save before you print is what I have to do so I don't loose all my work. Also it only comes in 32bit.

Every time I start to use Corel, I just remember how angry I am I wasted my money on this product.  It's garbage.  Save your money and buy Illustrator."

Side note, It would be nice to be able to lock the version that you save in for compatibility. The Coreldraw version at the makerspace that we use has X7 and X8's aren't readable. I invariably forget to save as x7 and end up having to recopy the file. You'd think I'd learn by now."

It is an added cost.  I might want it to be for 6-7 pcs.  It is for 5 pc and 5 tablet.  In my opinion this product is MS future money maker.  It is a great standard.  I have been using since 2006 when the banner system started...  Has not changed much in user learning curve.  There is couple versions: 1 is for 5pc/5tablet and 1 is for 1pc so beware.

The original product in 2005 was reputable and of good quality but whoever got a hold of the remaining DVD's are stealing your money.

365513,1.0,2018,"Here is what I find different about Rocket Languages, the focus is on learning to SPEAK Spanish. The other programs Ive used focused on written language. I love that the narrators speak slowly enough so I can understand the words and so I can learn to pronounce the words correctly. The lessons make sense and have real world applications. For me, this is far and away the best Spanish program I have used. I already feel more confident speaking Spanish and I find the correct words come to mind faster. I try to do one lesson a day. The lessons take about an hour. You don't have to do that much, but I really want to learn to speak the language so I am committed to spending the time necessary.
I did call customer service once because I could not get the playback to work. The person who helped me could not have been more attentive to my needs. She told me exactly what to do to fix the problem.
All in all, this is the only Spanish program I would recommend. I do think Duolingo is good for beginners who want to find out if they are committed to learning a language, however once you know you want to learn, then switch over to Rocket Languages. I hope you will be as happy as I am about the program."

365922,1.0,2018,"Ehrman's years as a Christian, an agnostic, a scholar and a historian has put him in a position to dispel the ignorance of many who have not pursued religious truth apart from their faith, however ill defined or informed.  This is regardless of whether others might agree with his conclusions, or have reason to question them or him on partisan grounds.  There is no doubt scholarly disagreement on many points.  I find myself put off by negative reviews that include objections to the scope of the work.  24 30 minute lectures obviously necessitates choices of selection and depth of treatment.  As Ehrman himself points out, there are multitudes of Christians (perhaps many of the best) who have never heard of these writings or their authors.  For those who have heard of them, this certainly will offer a way of thinking about what they are and how they cast light on the development of Christianity.  Paul himself said to graduate from milk to meat.  With regard to Christianity, is it true, is it kind, is it necessary is as well applied as in other realms.  On faith, I think I would say yes."

365935,0.0,2018,"am frankly uncomfortable discussing Cook's errors, which were limited to Chapter Three, a minor amount in an otherwise excellent course.  I am doing it because he is...just...wrong.

Here are some of his errors:  Cook says that church structure, or offices,  didn't appear quickly.  False.  The very first documents of Christianity are Paul's letters, and Paul in 1 Philippians, circa 61 AD, mentions overseers or bishops.  By  115 AD - less than a century since the crucifixion - the letters of Ignatius of Antioch make it clear there were  bishops in almost all cities with Christians.  The word 'catholic' meaning a universal or great church,  was used  by Ignatius in 115, who mentions it in a throwaway line, as if everybody already knew and acknowledged that there was a universal church.  Christians passed on the tradition in schools  as Paul mentions the first paid ministry was teaching, as does the Didache (Gal. 6.6, Did. 13.2).

Yet Cook claims some versions of Christianity were  'radical',  such as Marcion and his breakaway group, and the Gnostics, so there was no clear 'body of orthodox teaching', or a 'core of orthodoxy'.

That is utterly false, the reverse of the actual evidence.  The evidence of orthodoxy in Rome is proven by  Cook's own example, Marcion,  who began as an orthodox Christian, who was 'in communion' with the rest of the Christians, meaning he was allowed to receive the Eucharist, the sign of orthodoxy in Rome and everywhere.  Then  he peevishly developed his own  brand of Christianity by rejecting the Old Testament,  not to mention much of the New.  That was when the orthodox Christians, after exhaustively trying to bring Marcion to heel,  refused to let him receive the Eucharist.  If  orthodox beliefs were not yet in existence, why were all the  orthodox churches refusing to admit Marcion and his followers?

Cook states Jesus did not set up  offices, not ""clearly and directly"".  Mmm...there were clearly twelve apostles, three of them marked as being part of the inner circle, with  Peter  clearly  the leader over all.  And if these weren't offices, explain why the apostles had to vote for another member after the death of Judas.  All of Greco Roman society was hierarchical, so it would be very, very odd if early Christianity alone had no hierarchy.  Not to mention  the early Christians came from Second Temple Judaism, which had a high priest and  a sacrificial priesthood for the removal of sins, a belief in both the oral and written traditions, and gosh, funny thing, that's exactly what the great church ended up with.  Clearly and directly.

Although Cook mentions the Council of Jerusalem circa 49 AD he appears not to be able to connect the dots between a church council and a church.  Pretty hard to have one without the other.  Cook repeats Paul saying 'Peter was clearly in the wrong' without mentioning the blindingly obvious, that Peter and Paul  resolved the issue.  Again, proof of a great church.  Also, dogma develops; it took centuries for the the dogma of the trinity to be concluded.

Cook says  Eusebius was incorrect when he claimed there was  an actual  body of orthodoxy, kept from the time of the apostles.  Yet this was the argument of every  other church father before Constantine.  Wouldn't they have known?  We read proof of this orthodoxy  in 1 Clement  in 95 AD, in the letters of Ignatius, 115 AD, the writings of Justin Martyr, who wrote, ""The Eucharist was sent by a messenger to those who were not physically present, and with whom communion should be maintained.""

And Cook is simply wrong to include the small Gnostic groups as part of Christianity.  If it was so hard to distinguish between Gnostics and the Christians, why was the anti Christian Celsus, who wrote against Christianity so clear on which was which?  At least three times the Christian hating Celsus refers to the orthodox as the vast multitude, and as the Gnostics as tiny philosophical groups.

 In 'Against Heresies' Irenaeus attacked the claims of the Gnostics  by pointing out the unbroken line of orthodox teachings and bishops In this order, and by this succession, the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles, and the preaching of the truth, have come down to us. And this is most abundant proof that there is one and the same vivifying faith, which has been preserved in the Church from the Apostles until now, and handed in truth.

Long before the Nag Hammadi find, the various schools of Gnosticism were thought to have sprung into existence after Christianity. They were regarded as a pagan reaction to Christianity, a second-century heresy. It is now increasingly clear that this was the truth, and that there were no Gnostics until long after Christianity began. Certainly not until long after all the books of the New Testament were written.

Here is one scholar on the topic: ""Up to the present no decisive proof of the non-Christian origin of Gnosticism has been found, either in the New Testament or in the Nag Hammadi writings or elsewhere. No Gnostic text has been found that we can date with certainty, or even with a degree of probability, to a pre-Christian time"" (Petrement, p 10 'A Separate God"").

Here are some good books on the subject: ""Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: the Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony"" by Richard Bauckham, ""Lord Jesus Christ"" by Hurtado, ""Torah in the Mouth,  ""Early Text of the New Testament,  ""Jesus and the Oral Gospel Tradition,  and Structuring Early Christian Memory:  Jesus in Tradition, Performance and Text.

Again, I am sorry to write this, when Cook is a fine scholar, and the rest of his lectures are simply splendid.  I just felt that if you get this one idea wrong  - that the church had an orthodox core which it held to always - I am afraid you could get everything else wrong."
365993,-1.0,2018,"I am writing this review, hoping that it may help someone.... you will undoubtedly encounter problems with the program and Rosetta Stone's ""tech support"" is likely the worst I've ever spoken with.  It seems their only solution is to rename a program file, erasing all data, or pay them $20 an hour and give them remote access to do the same thing, or pay more for their latest program.  In our case, our children must use this version for their school program, so we needed a work around - we need the program to work and can't afford to lose months of school progress just because the computer was shut down.

Here's what our experience (and many others if you do an internet search) has been:
*  We installed the program and began running it on Dec 20, 2017.  All seemingly worked fine, though the computer it was installed on was never disconnected from the wall.
*  Fast forward to Feb 11, 2018.  We rearranged the room the computer was in, so the computer needed to be properly shut down and disconnected and moved across to an adjacent wall.  Hooked everything back up and turned on the computer.  One of the boys went to continue working on his course progress, but the program wouldn't run and only gave us an error 2125.  We contact Rosetta Stone who explained this was a very common error and told us to follow directions they'd send us a link to, or we could pay them $20 an hour to do it for us, or we could spend a lot more money and purchase their newest program.  Their online directions first suggest uninstalling various listed anti-virus software (none of which we have).  Second, they instruct how to rename their ""tracking"" file, which comes with this lovely note: ""Note: After renaming this file, your course progress won't be available in Rosetta Stone. Unfortunately, this is necessary since the file is probably corrupt and not repairable.""  That was enough to send everyone into a panic because they'd almost finished the first year of Spanish and all that progress would be lost (though we did find another work around for that).  Thing is, Rosetta Stone says loss of data is ""necessary"" and that the file is ""corrupt.""  We know neither of these things to be true.  Their program has serious flaws and their only suggestions are to charge the customer/user more and more money.
*  So, what can you do when you encounter error 2123 or 2125 (we received both so I can speak to these two though the solution will likely work for other error messages as well)?  Run compatibility by right clicking on the original application (not the shortcut).  Go to properties, click compatibility tab then check the option to run Windows Vista Service Pack 2.  Open the program and it runs, picking up right where the student left off without any data loss.  This work around needs to be done each time the program is launched,  but it works and allows the student to move forward.
** I'd like to thank ""Lightning Bolt"" on You Tube for suggesting this solution.  A quick internet search yields a plethora of people struggling for answers; no help from Rosetta Stone (though they love to try and get more $ out of you); and, thankfully, a large community of people who have found various work arounds they are willing to share.  I hope reposting here helps someone else."

Most of the time it only takes a reboot to solve the error but sometimes it takes much more.  More than once we have lost ALL progress for the children and now it looks like I will have to delete and re-install the program AGAIN in an attempt to get it to run.  Too much money for faulty programming.  The customer support is only for a short time without charge.

366113,-1.0,2018,"I ordered the Homeschool Spanish Level 1-5 Set for my daughter back on September 30th after a friend enjoyed the system with their homeschooled children. But, we have not been able to use the product since. I purchased it through Amazon, which I later found out actually shipped from a third party called TwinSuns. When the order arrived, there was no code with the order. So I had contacted TwinSuns and explained to them that we never received the code. This process took a couple of months. But, they finally sent me the codes. I put the codes in and I was able to get it installed. I got as far as setting up her account and trying to run the first lesson. Then we had an issue with the microphone/earplugs. By this time it was Christmas and told her to just wait and we'll start Spanish the second semester. So then we get to January. We have tried running the program several times and now get an error message. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it several times and it just will not work. Before you ask, YES, my brand new laptop computer meets all the system requirements. So no, that is not the issue. At this point, I'd really like to just send they whole thing back for a refund, but I doubt they will refund me. Oh, and I might also add, I've not been able to get the disk with the extra material to work either. The whole thing has been a huge, expensive disappointment. I've sent an inquiry to Rosetta Stone directly hoping they can help. Otherwise, I'm not going to be happy throwing away a $140 and will definitely NOT be recommending Rosetta Stone to anyone."

366496,1.0,2018,This is an absolutely invaluable resource that provides amazing visuals when studying the Scriptures. My students and I have benefited richly from this PowerPoint tool and I highly recommend it for every pastor and layman who is seeking to provide visual aid to their study and teaching of the Scriptures. It is jam-packed with an immense amount of geographical and archaeological photos that helps one gain a more complete sense of what God was communicating 2000 years ago. The authors have gone through great lengths and have traveled to what feels like every museum and archaeological site to bring you the perfect visual aid to help you transcend time and space when you are expositing the Word of God.
366497,1.0,2018,"Wow! I hardly know what to say about this phenomenal collection of photographs on the Gospels. Over the years, Ive seen attractive photos in books I have and noticed the name Todd Bolen in the photo credits. I had even heard others reference a website called BiblePlaces.com and talk about wonderful photo collections that could be purchased there. Now that I have Photo Companion to the Bible: The Gospels in my hands I know what all the hype was about. For the record, the hype was fully justified.

All 89 chapters of the four Gospels are covered by more than 10,000 pictures. I suppose the most common usage for this resource would be for those who want to create sharp PowerPoint presentations. For that use, theres nothing free on the Internet that even comes close to what we have here. Putting up a slide for a sermon on some passage in the Gospels will now be greatly upgraded for those who possess this resource.

I see another use for this product that may not be as often discussed. There could hardly be a better resource for those who enjoy some visual learning mixed in. To me, theres something incredible about seeing a picture of a Bible site for some spectacular story in Scripture. It gets my imagination fired up even more. Further, you will find photos here of cultural elements and even photos of artifacts from museums. There are some things that are simply not common in our day and culture that we need help visualizing. As an added bonus, I saw several historic photographs for those doing deep study.

Im not as software savvy as some, but I found this resource easy to navigate. I have the disk, but saw where you can download a digital version as well if that fits your needs better. If you purchase this resource, you will be allowed to use it in teaching, preaching, and even church newsletters. If you want to use it in books, or other commercial products or websites, you can contact Mr. Bolen to set that up. Each photo has a brief note to explain what you're looking at. Your purchase comes with free lifetime updates. Apparently, Mr. Bolen wants us to be pleased, and promises to work with anyone not completely satisfied.

One thing that really sets this resource apart is the pictures of places that are difficult to get to for the modern tourist. In other words, there are pictures here of places you will never see on the average Bible tour. I so appreciate this resource that I hope Mr. Bolen will put together future photo collections for some hard-to-find Old Testament locations (he has some of these pictures on his website). In fact, he ought to make one of those big beautiful coffee table books for Bible sites. The photos here are truly of that quality.

This is a special resource and I highly recommend it.

I'm not sure yet if it's mac compatible, since I see a lot of reviews saying it isn't. (mine when I was little definitely was.)
maybe it's the fact it's a 20 year old game. I already know I'll have to jack with the compatibility mode on my pc to make it work.
yeah, I kinda bought this for nostalgia's sake? not that I'm really gonna hardcore play it. just because I loved it so much and maybe want to force it on my future children."

I don't know how the kids of this day will appreciate the game since I can only imagine the look of it being a bit dated along with perhaps the controls. However, I wouldn't assume it's much of a difference to how point and clicks are currently (or ever). HIEROGLYPHS!"
370671,1.0,2018,"I was never able to finish this when I was a kid and so the opportunity to finally accomplish it was pretty nice. Only took a couple hours of continuous play but well worth it. I remembered suffering for hours at my family's desktop and making little progress so well worth it. Incredibly great. These are great games for kids and even apparently adults, to work on math and writing skills."

The format seems to be different every time I try using it. Comments sections ""fail to open"", old items are mixed in and
pop ups and flashing advertisements add to the distractions. When I go to their web site on my laptop, I am often not recognized and have to enter my user name and password. The online edition is marginally unusable and I only make the attempt when the delivery of the physical paper fails.

Lousy driving mechanics, constant lag, lazy graphics, and all it is is driving Matchbox cars, there's no challenges or any real fun to be had. You do not get the option to change vehicles or even to cruise around, the entire thing becomes tedious and repetitive real fast. The bare minimum of what counts as a PC game and nothing more than a gimmicky promo for the toys. Skip this and just buy your kid the cars instead, you'll be getting more for your money for it."

The cover states   To be sold with qualifying camcorder or camera purchase. Not to be sold individually. FRAUD?! Misrepresentation at the very least.

374051,1.0,2018,"""Oregon Trail"" was one of my favorite games growing up.  Ostensibly, it was an educational experience that taught kids strategy, history, and other important lessons, but quite a bit of the fun was seeing what calamities could strike your party along the way, and naming the party members after family, friends, favorite characters, or even people you disliked, and watching them get killed off one by one by dysentery, snakebite, drowning, etc.  Morbid, but not graphic, so this game could get away with so many deaths and still be labeled as educational.

""Oregon Trail 2"" would have to be the best of the ""Oregon Trail"" games, in my opinion.  This version of the game relies less on sheer luck and more on strategy, gives you more options in what type of supplies to buy and how to react to disasters and events along the trail, offers more choices in occupations and skills and which trail to travel (you can not only go to Oregon, but the Salt Lake Valley and California during the gold rush!), and even play as a trail guide or wagon train captain if just being an ordinary greenhorn is too easy for you.  The game also has a wider variety of music, characters to interact with, and scenery shots based on real photos (albeit obviously Photoshopped in many instances...).  It's a lot of fun, and while random chance can still devastate your party, you still feel like you have more control over your party's fate.

The downside to this game is that, being an older release, you have to get creative if you want to play it on a newer machine.  I found a way to play this game on Windows 10, but it entails a roundabout way of installing the game that I found via Google... and the river-crossing videos won't play, as they're QuickTime based.  I don't mind this -- the river-crossing videos are in no way essential to enjoying the game -- but it does make me wonder if the QuickTime-based Columbia River segment will work properly (I almost always avoid rafting the river in the end, opting for either the toll road or paying someone to raft me and skipping the hard work...).

A fun and nostalgic game, this is still well worth owning and playing even if it takes a little extra work to get it to run on newer machines.  It's a fun way to immerse yourself in a bit of American history, and learn a little strategy along the way."

375011,1.0,2018,"Great program and atleast one of the discs can run on any computer and it is the best disc.

The disc home Christian library deluxe can be run on any computer. You do not have to run the setup program.  To be with the documents on this disc, all you need is the Adobe acrobat program. Just go to Windows Explorer and then go to the CD-ROM drive. Double-click on the file heritage.pdf and it will load into Adobe acrobat if you have it on your computer.

The Logos bible cd requires windows 3.1 or windows 95(maybe works on windows 32bit windows xp, but don't know that)-but windows 3.1 is very easy to get to run on a modern operating system if you still have Windows 3.1 lying around. For windows 3.1 you just need the DOS box program, which is a free download from their website.  Then you just run the setup program and then exit DOS box once the setup program is finished. Then you can run windows 3.1.  To go higher than 640*480 resolution, you need to install the right windows 3.1 drivers.(on dosbox the s3 drivers specifically)

Logos bible cd is also a good program, but not necessary for product to be worth it.  It has a good search engine.  It includes many cross-references of places in the Bible that all say the same thing. It also has in red color the words that God says."

379265,1.0,2018,"I loved this game as a child, so I have to rate it well. BUT!! It is not compatible with any computer system past like, Windows ME, not even if run in compatibility mode. So unfortunately I cannot recommend a modern purchase unless you have a very old computer, or can install an old OS for it."

379762,1.0,2018,We needed this version as the newer ones will not read previous version templates.  Very glad that they still offer this for sale.
379794,1.0,2018,"I can't even fully describe how much I love this program, I've used it for ALL KINDS of projects! I use the full page one the most, printing stickers, magnets, and all kinds of things. I LOVE that you can custom crop images, you can resize, reverse flip the image, stretch, layer images, it's just all kinds of fantastic! Unfortunately, I can't install it on my new computer, which came with Windows 10!  Going to try the newest version, I really hope they didn't mess with it too much!

*EDIT: After reading reviews of the newest version, I am NOT purchasing it! Looks like its a shadow of how good this one was, and Brderbund does not allow feedback either! Doesnt seem they are even interested in whether the customer is happy - I hope their profits are reflecting that lack of concern!!"

I would not recomend this to anyone but I would recommend the newer version."

379973,1.0,2018,"Being a huge fan of the 'Cyberpunk' culture and genre.
This game was an absolute must for me when I first heard about it way back in 2009-2010.
(Still has one of the best extended trailers for anything I have ever seen)

I can say is that I honestly loved this game, everything about it was really well done and over the top with keeping the atmosphere dark and cyberpunk themed.
I went through the entire game without killing anyone or being seen on my first playthrough too.
Which was extremely amazing to be able to do in a game. And felt really good.

The music in this game is phenomenal and moody. Lots of ambient and syths.
The plot is thick and keeps you interested, has a relative theme to our modern world, and your choices matter.
This is a prequel to the highly praised Barbie Horse Adventure: Blue Ribbon Race game that came out in 2003 on GBA
This is an FPS-Stealth/Action-RPG game that has unique and very fun elements of gameplay.
Highly recommended!"
380107,-1.0,2018,"Don't waste your time.  Though feature rich, seemingly versatile, it's all pointless if you can't export your product.

Basically the program is ripe to crash anytime you try to do anything requiring memory.  I have a pretty high-end system running off a SSD, but it makes no difference.  Whether I'm loading transitions or saving a modest 30 minute slideshow, there are constant crashes.  Though there is some incredibly slow error recovery (the infamous last show did not save correctly shall we reload option), it sometimes fails completely, and even worse, will rewrite your last saved functioning version with empty.  furthermore, the plethora of auxilliary files it creates cannot be opened with the program so...useless.

In other words, you might spend hours and unless you save multiple versions each time (at least 3) expect to lose all your work on a dime."
380315,1.0,2018,"I just received this software (open box) and it works just fine in Photoshop CS6-32, so I'm not sure what those who are complaining about its not working in earlier versions are doing wrong. For the record, it also works fine in CS3, which I keep around for certain legacy plugins that don't work in CS5 and newer. I do not have any Photoshop CC software so I can't comment on compatibility with the newest versions of PS.

Now, full disclosure, all I did was install the program and do a couple of quick cutouts so if I run into issues down the road I will update this review. One thing I did find a bit odd was that KO told me one of my files needed to be converted to RGB (which was already the case). At any rate it opened the file after the ""conversion"" and operated normally.

Knockout is about the best masking software I've used and I was happy to find it again since I no longer have my original Procreate version."

It has a tendency to crash, sometimes constantly; (Ive used it on several different computers, with different versions of Windows); it will quit running then it may start working again. The support forum is pretty useless; there are many questions there that have been unanswered for months or years.

Super light-weight, faster than lightning on hardware more than a decade old, it's good for running those apps and games that Windows 7 and Windows 10 refuse to run.

Just don't plan on using the internet. Or even connecting to the public internet for that matter, as there hasn't been an update for Windows 2000 since July of 2010.

The program works well for any graphed project design not just counted cross stitch. Although you can design with actual looking stitches, you can also design with plain colored squares too. The software has hundreds of colors available and you can print your charted designs on your printer in several ways, color, black and white, as solid blocks, as symbols or as stitches. The website has made updates, upgrades, and a user manual available to download. I wish the manual had been included but all you get is the installation booklet.

""Hello,
Thank you for sending your question.

The Pro level of the program includes an image exporting feature that can export into JPEG format.  It sounds as though you probably have the Standard level.  You can confirm by looking at the CD and/or by selection 'About' under 'Help.

To create a PDF, you can print to the built-in PDF printer of Windows 10.""

So, if you don't have Windows 10, you are screwed. You can print, but you absolutely cannot export to any format. You can only save as the pattern maker file format. Crazy that Export is not in the file menu of this software. You should not have to pay three to four times more just to export!"

On February 14, 2018 we sent a detailed email to LaserSoft's Florida office and when that did not elicit a response, we forwarded the email to LaserSoft's head office in Germany. That was over 6 weeks ago and ....still NO RESPONSE.

In December, the voicemail messages blamed ""our current staff situation"" for their inability to respond to phone calls. To day, on April 5, their voice mail message still blames ""our current staff situation"" to respond by phone and requesting an email. As noted above, this too appears to result in NO RESPONSE.

I wanted to get both RCF 2 & RCF 3 again and try to install on my newer Windows 7 desktop computer and enjoy playing those roller coaster games again. I was rather surprised that I had no problems installing both disks onto my Windows 7 desktop with no problems & the game or software works just fine as it did on my older Windows 98SE computer some 15 or more years ago. What you do is design, test and ride various types of roller coasters in several themed scenarios. They have wooden coasters and several versions of steel coasters on both software versions. You also can save and name your own designed roller coasters as well for future rides on them. Pretty nifty and quite 3D or very close to a 3D riding experience on the completed roller coaster.  I am doing the same review for both Roller Coaster Factory 2 and Roller Coaster Factory 3 because they are equally good and made by the same software producer/maker....Valu Soft.
I have done other roller coaster software items over the years, including most of the RCT versions from 1 thru 3 and a few other Roller Coaster building software products not available anymore. I am also playing RCT [Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 and 2], & they also load up easily on my Windows 7 computer just fine.
IF you like making your own roller coasters on the computer....naming and riding them after it's done....these RCF 1 and RCF2 are for you. I'd carefully check to make sure it will work on any Windows computer from Vista to 10 before getting these older software. I have used them on Windows 98SE and XP and now Windows 7 and works good on these 3 Window versions.

389843,1.0,2018,"I bought this program to replace a Bible study program that was rendered obsolete by my upgrade to Windows 10. I have been very pleased with the product. This is a feature rich Bible study program with a lot of functionality that you would you will find only in very expensive Bible Study programs. It does not contain the NIV version (which I dearly love) but it does contain the WEB version of the bible which is a more modern translation of the Bible.

One very cool feature is that it allows you to create books from your own personal Bible studies and import them into the product turning them into your own personal study guides that can be referenced directly inside SwordSearcher. It has many other great features as well which I hope you will research at the product's website.

For those of you who study the Bible, you will find SwordSearcher to be a very useful addition to your Bible study regimen."
389844,1.0,2018,"Responding to this for the 2nd time. It is different than my old Quickverse program but easy to use. As I get into it, time will tell."

390014,1.0,2018,Love this software
390026,1.0,2018,"This is a perfect mechanism for learning English!  ESL (""English as a Second Language"") classes should introduce students to video games that combine spoken voice with printed dialog. Amazon Trail is challenging, nonviolent, and complex enough to play many times without becoming redundant. As a bonus, students learn a little biology, history, and cultural anthropology for this region.
Played well on my Windows 10 system, after I reset the color depth to 32-bit."
390098,1.0,2018,Does the job well!
390264,1.0,2018,"I purchased this and was weary since it was old and may not work newer PCs. It will but you have to a compatibility check, and change it to Windows 7 and then once you do that copy the Millie folder from CD to HDD and create a shortcut to Millie.exe and it works and you don't have to keep loading in the disc. Only downside is it will not fill up whole screen. Bothers me, but not my son and thats all that counts."
390357,1.0,2018,gift for nephew and he loved it !!!!
390499,1.0,2018,"My son loves the game. It's just as I remembered it. Would not run on my PC with Windows 10, but I did not try running compatibility mode so it might of worked if I tried. Luckily I had a couple old towers running 98 and xp so I didn't take the time to test compatibility mode. You can get an old tower at a thrift store for 25.00 so don't let that discourage you. Great game, nostalgia overload."
390674,1.0,2018,"Very nice images. Print quality is very good. After trimming the paper, see below, they look very good in 16""x20"" frames.

Important note:  Images are not as pictured, they are 16""x20"" images, but shipped with white boarders, which make them 16.5""x24"". So I had to trim the white boarders to fit a 16""x20"" frame, which is not an easy task due to the curl in the paper from being in the shipping tube."
390729,1.0,2018,Loved this Nancy Drew game!
390730,1.0,2018,Very happy with seller and item
390790,1.0,2018,"Problem Resolved: I initially reported that the program did not have a registration code with it.  I contacted the vendor.  They were very apologetic, emailed me the code right away, and promised to check their stock to see if other packages were missing codes. I also contacted Text Aloud, who verified that this company IS an authorized vendor on Amazon. All good now.

Program gives a lot of ""bang for your buck"" - many improvements over previous (but good) versions
I used it years ago to convert my college texts into MP3's so I could do my ""reading"" while at the gym or doing chores. I loved it then, but there are MANY improvements.  You no longer have to manually copy and paste text into the program.  Now it has extensions to use in Word, and with various browsers, so you can have it read a document, web page, or highlighted text directly from the program you are using. It still allows you to convert documents to MP3, even Multiple documents in one action.

It is very easy to use.
You open the document (s), Text Aloud converts them to text. You can rename or edit the text before conversion. Then you can to choose which ""voice"" you want (previously premium add-on voices now included free), and set the speed and pitch to what sounds best to you.  The voices sound surprisingly natural, especially once you dial in those settings to your personal preferences. The conversion process is quite fast.
User Tips: Sometimes it ""reads"" things in an amusing way, like # as ""number"" when, in context, it would be ""hashtag"" or per se as ""per southeast."" There is an easy workaround if it consistently pronounces something, like a name, oddly. You can always edit your text and write out what the symbol (e.g. hashtag) or word SHOULD sound like phonetically before conversion. It is useful to remove periods after abbreviations like ""Mr."" so it does not pause like you are at the end of a sentence.  TextAloud does a good job already, these are just ideas to make your final MP3 a little bit better.
Note: I sometimes play my text-aloud MP3's with a podcast app that allows me to tweak the replay speed up or down during playback, for greater flexibility if I get to a complicated portion of a text.."

390987,1.0,2018,"This was an excellent 'sandbox' style design game when I played it as a youngster in the early 2000's. The graphics are very low and the score is silent, but the game was satisfying during a time when social media and smart phones were not a daily concern. Wouldn't mind purchasing a copy when I have little ones."

The errors are keep coming up with '#sound not found' or others ""not found message windows"". To be clear, this not a single CD/eMedia issue. The 1st CD was all scratched and I try to work it on different PCs, no that much of a luck. The 2nd CD was OK on the outside, but same problems... 3rd attempt, I have downloaded the file from eMedia's website - the same issues. The only education that can be obtained from this item (CD/download) is how to waste your time and holdup your nerves."

392700,1.0,2018,"I remember playing this game for hours on end as a little girl, and even in my early teens. I loved it, and I was quite disappointed when I tried to get it for my younger brothers and found it would not work on modern computers. If it is ever updated, I will definitely introduce it to the children in my life, and probably play it with them a time or two!"
392712,1.0,2018,"The software says its for XP and lower, the CD wouldn't install and trying to run the install executables individually would give an error about the wrong OS.  I was using windows virtual machine running XP, but that made it difficult to back up the quicken data file and to print out reports.  Just found 2 ways that work natively in windows 7.
1.  Unzip the data1.cab file from the CD into a directory.  There are about 20-25 files, and one of them is qrental.exe which is the main program and it runs fine with no issues in widows 7.
2.  I also copied the quicken files out of my XP virtual machine into windows 7: the program files directory, as well as my quicken data file which gets saved to the My Documents directory by default.  The quicken directory from the program files directory also had qrental.exe in it.  That also ran directly in windows 7.

I have searched for answers on this topic before and only saw posts that say its unsupported or to try selecting different compatibility modes, run as administrator, etc..  None of those thing help at all, and none seemed to mention this."

393443,1.0,2018,"Garmin worked well going from town to town,  I would not drive in Italy without it.  There are so many ROUNDABOUTS and Garmin got me though them. I used it going from Milan airport to Lake Como, Lake Lugano, Lake Maggoire, Tirano, Trento to Venice.  Going from Como, Italy to Tirana, Italy I lost count on roundabouts at 86. (Only a two hour drive- took me three) The instructions were great.  It did get us lost a few times in the mountain area and in construction zones, but we laughed a lot and saw some wonderful unexpected sites.  The drive times were iffy I added an addition 50% to them and that worked for me.  Driving in Italy was stressful, roads a very narrow and winding. Beware of the Toll Booths, read the instructions before going - after a while you will get the hang of it. We had a great time."

After all these years I do not have access to that number. So I went on the website - where I still have my online account - and went to the feedback section and sent an email asking for the number.  Never heard back from them.  So I figured I would just spend the money and buy the program again.  Nope!!!  First of all, I am running Windows 7.  On one screen it says the highest windows it will go to is XP, another says Win 7.

Well, I figured I would still try....so I entered in all my payment info and hit submit and got and error message....on their end.  They could not display the page.  So, now I cannot buy a new copy, cannot use the old copy, have all the data and cannot access it.

With these caveats, the program does execute (ten year old Mac are available and inexpensive but require extra effort on the part of the first time Carrara user. While also, Carrara 5 is an older version, and apparently Carrara is no longer in business, I obtained excellent resultes with this landmark 3D graphing program (the old Carrara 5 manual, while limited, is valid and precise for those entering 3D graphics).

At this point, I don't see how or why I'd use the actual compiler, I'm very adept with Gnu C (and GDB) and MS CL. I'm sure the book still stands up though. No reason you can't use it (and examples) with the latest compilers."

401268,1.0,2018,"I promised myself I wouldn't give a gushy review on this game so I will only state the BLOODY OBVIOUS and then move on. Offically, this game is called an OPEN WORLD ACTION ADVENTURE GAME (6th Generation). What does that mean? Games prior to GTA Vice City had a story line and main core missions that you progressed through in a LINEAR FASHION.  GTA Vice City (VC) was different. Get Stuck on a Mission? Play a SubMission Like Assassinations. Get stuck on a SubMission? Do an honest day's work like Like Fire, Police & Ambulance volunteer. Not in the mood for doing Honest Work? Do a Rampage. Not in the mood to Rampage? Go look for some Greenies...And On & On & On.  And then there is the music and the commercials and the hysterical NPR send up 'PRESS THE ISSUES' with Maurice Chavez.

If you are committed to play the game, you must PROMISE ME NOT TO CHEAT (Like unending Cash or Lives or simular HACKS). You can only play with what the game permits which is ALOT!!!  Before you even think of playing this game, you need TWO THINGS, A decent Controller and The GRAND THEFT AUTO VICE CITY OFFICIAL STRATEGY GUIDE (Tim Bogenn) BRADLEY GAMES. I use a Killah NyKo AIR CONTROLLER which has twin Fans to cool your sweaty palms down as comfort equates better gameplay.  THEN you need to program it to the nth degree. It's literally the difference bewteen LIFE & DEATH!!! As far as the Guide goes, you can not get 100% without it. FYI,
If you are still stuck---virtually everyone has a MISSIONS SOLUTION on YouTube!!!

STRATEGY. You are Thomas (TOMMIE) Vercetti and you are having a REALLY BAD DAY. You just got robbed and now owe the MOB not only the lost YahYo BUT the Buy Money.  To make matters worse, You are an EX FELON with no job, no furture, no credit, no friends, no woman and most importantly, NO MONEY. So what do you do? Have yourself a GOOD MAN CRY...four seconds ought to do it... and now get back to work. DO NOT DO A MISSION BEFORE YOU COWBOY UP. NO COWBOY UP? NO MISSION!!! What does that mean? Steal a car and go near the Great Mall and pick up some free Body Armour. Then beat up some tourists up you get $200.00. Then find yourself a HORIZONTAL RECREATION SPECIALIST (Blonde in short Black Skirt or Hispanic in Fish Net Stockings or the Dominican Republic in cutoffs. They only come out after dark). Take her an your car to a secluded spot and watch your Health (HEART) increase from 100pts to 125!!! Now go find some free weapons and then DO A MISSION OR TWO.
The EARLY GAME is about balance. That means do some missions, some sub missions and ALWAYS BE LOOKING FOR GREENIES (see Book). The more greenies you have the more killah weapons you earn.  Once you get 60 Greenies, you score a MINIGUN and that is the GAME CHANGER.

Vice City is divided into two halves---East Bay & MAIN Land. You can't get into the MainLand until you have completed The Burt Reynold's TOY Chopper Mission (THE HARDEST IN THE GAME) and the COL Cortez VIETNAM mission.  Knock out as many Greenies, Robberies, etc. on the EAST BAY before going to the MAIN Land.  FYI, there is a trick to solving the TOY CHOPPER MISSION---everything is an IMMEDIATE HARD 'ROTARY' RT Turn to place the Dynamite on top of the Barrel. If your controller is properly dialed in and you know how to turn 'Rotery Lt/Rotery RT (E & Q keys), this mission is a snap. It took me 16 years of off & on to figure it out without the Guide, so no giving up. GET STUCK---GO TO 'YOU TUBE'!!!

My final hint is 'SAFE HOUSES'. Although you must own all to get 100%, always be buying SAFE HOUSES (SAVE HOUSES) The key safehouses are The MALL CONDO (your First) and ELSWANKO Casa In EAST BAY. On the Main Land, beside Diaz's Mansion is the Hyman Condo & the Skumole Shack. The others are just bobbles.  Always be Saving!!! You do a Mission or score a couple of Greenies, immediately SAVE IT. Then back out (ESQ) and look at yer stats.  FINAL, FINAL HINT. KNOW THY Whereabouts.  The Key to EAST BAY is knowing where the PAINT SHOPS ARE---On on FOUNTAIN AVENUE and the road next to your ELSWANKO Casa (RT). Got one star? Shake it off. Got two stars? Change yer clothes. Got 3-6 Stars? Ye Old Paint Shoppes. (FYI) MAIN LAND has a Paint Shop & a Pharma next door for heath regeneration.

There are NEWER GAMES and ones with better graphics & AI. But for a Y2K game with Name Hollywood Actors Dennis Hopper, Blondie, Burt Renyolds, Gary Debucy, etc., this game set the standard for TOTAL IMMERSION GAMING...GTA VC is to Gaming what The Beatles' SGT PEPPER LHCB' is to Rock&Roll---there will always be NEWER, but N-E-V-E-R BETTER. I've been to Athens, Greece and that is a BUCKET LIST---my next BUCKET LIST is scoring 100% on this game. Wish me Luck (Im trying to break 69%)."

401611,-1.0,2018,"don't like at all - sluggish, complicated to navigate, had problems with the accented characters of non-english surnames and localities, I went back to using an archaic and now obsolete version of Family Tree Maker (2006 Version) which does a far better job than Reunion 9"
401735,-1.0,2018,"Very disappointed in this product. I've been a Biblesoft customer since the 80's, (back when each version of the bible came on 5,  5 1/2 floppy discs). I recently upgraded to the ""one touch"" version which basically sold me again all the add-ons I had been buying a-la-cart for the last 30 years only to find out that after loading the full program onto your computer it is only accessible as long as you are on line and their computers are working. Twice in the last 6 months (that I know of) they were down rendering the program useless, it won't even open. Tech support knows this is an issue is but couldn't explain why this is the case. Will not spend any more of my money with this company."
401736,1.0,2018,I received the PC Study Bible more than a month after I ordered it. It loaded on my pc fine! I love this program! It works fine with windows 8. Im not sure about high versions of windows.
401737,-1.0,2018,"I've had this for several years and even worked fine when my computer upgraded to Windows 10.  BUT.....when that computer broke and I bought a new one, this program wouldn't install.  I called Biblesoft and only got voicemail and left 2 or 3 messages, but they never returned my calls.  They also didn't reply to my messages I left on their website.  I since learned they have no intention of supporting this PCStudy Bible 5.1 on a computer using Windows 10.  I'm 75 now and can't afford their newer versions which run well over $1,000.  I wouldn't pay another dime to this company who places no value on support or respect for former customers or on their own customer relations.  Run away!"
401738,1.0,2018,I like the easiness of using it and also being able to pull 8 translations up at one time.
401776,-1.0,2018,"There are two things to consider when purchasing Bible software. The second thing is actually more important than the first. The first thing to consider is if the software is a good product. I actually love the Biblesoft product. However, and this is the more important second thing, the company that sells and manages this product is so incredibly bad that I would strongly recommend no one buys this product or any of their products...ever. They will not maintain their software for system upgrades but will require you to purchase books you already own over and over again. They offer almost no customer support (I say almost because I've not been able to reach anyone for about 2 years). The online program does not work properly. There is just nothing good to say. It's like buying a car that won't ever start. It looks good in the driveway, but you'll never drive it on the road. That this is supposed to be a Christian company is greatly disappointing."
401777,1.0,2018,the new OneTouch Series is awesome!!!!!
401778,-1.0,2018,"The software itself is actually quite good.  I've used it since 1995, however, when I switched to Mac, the software continues to lock up.  Last year I had to contact Biblesoft's Technical Support department repeatedly before ever hearing back from them.  That was then, but this is now.  This week, after trying to redownload my software yet again, their website is having difficulties with my request, so I once again have had to reach out to the Biblesoft Tech Support people.  In vintage form, once again, after repeated attempts, by phone, through their website and by email, I have yet to hear back from either the Tech Support or Customer Service departments.  So while I like the software, I have scored Biblesoft with the lowest score, since I feel the people are not there to back their product.  Buyers, beware."

What I wanted was a simple word processor, a basic spreadsheet, and an onboard database capability. Unfortunately, Microsoft no longer makes a current version, so it took me a year to locate Works 9, which was made for Vista, but it works just fine in Windows 10. The word section is adequate for letter or article writing, spreadsheet can help set up a budget for home or home office, and database can do small business inventory or recipes. There are preloaded templates for calendars, cards, announcements, all sorts of things. For a price of about $100 you can get a full featured program that can give you the basic tools you need. Separate programs for word, spread, and data can easily run $300 or better each."

It came with the wrong instructions to begin with. After a period of 11 hours, over 2 days, it finally works (kind of). Connectivity is touch and go and there is nothing simple about it. Tablets, smart tvs and smart phones beware. There was a reason it was so deeply discounted. I would have returned it except for the recent reports of Amazon closing accounts that have multiple returns. Ive never returned anything, but no guarantees for the future."
404635,1.0,2018,It works well once I figured out the poor instructions. It seems to have a longer range and a strong signal
404636,-1.0,2018,I am normally positive and optimistic but this router is not up to a demanding (150 meg internet).Throughput was slower than the previous cable company supplied both on wifi and  wired usage.

I sent it back and replaced it with another brand( a bit more money)and all expectations were met.

Believe me that I have tried them all such as PC Stitch and others.  Pattern Maker has the most accurate conversion tool from images to patterns of any of the programs.  It is easy to refine the details once you learn the program.  There are many stitch symbols that can be used and one must just make sure that your printer is able to print out some of the symbols or you will end up with blank blocks.  That too is easy to correct by changing those blank symbols to one that will print.  I actually search through my fonts and pull in PC Stitch symbols and any other wingding font symbols that I want if I don't like the ones selected for me by the program.  It is easy to change the number of threads in use, to lighten or darken a design and best of all it will actually allow you to see the real size of different fabrics for the same pattern such as 14, 16 and 18 gauge cloth so that you can select the pattern you want to use.

407470,1.0,2018,"I am so damn grateful for this disk. My MacbookPro died randomly and I needed a Mac for iMovie purposes. I ended up buying a used white macbook which had imovie and all that good stuff installed. The moment the lady cleared the mac and reset it, it would now longer allow me to access the app store due to Apples limitations (AKA restricting things to make you buy a newer version). I spent over a year trying to figure out ways to get imovie on this computer and everything failed. I somehow stumbled upon the iLife disk in a forum and I am so grateful I did. I actually cried when the install finished and everything was working and installed properly. Also, this shipping was stupidly fast. I bought this on a Thursday around noon and it was at my house Friday around 10:00am and wasn't set to be delivered for another 2 days."

The real DAT is 5 hours exam. The full-length practice exams get me familiar with the timing. I coincidently find out Crack the DAT through DAT Destroyer study public group when I bought DAT Destroyer written by Dr. Jim Romano. Many of his students asked him how to ger skills for PAT section.

410554,1.0,2018,"This blu-ray disc was just what I've been looking for!  Contrary to a certain one-star reviewer, I LOVE the fact that the DVD has ""Static Views, Few Transitions, No Camera Action""!  Why?  Because when I project it to fill a wall or large space for background ambience at parties, there are no moving transitions that make the wall look like it's spinning or that people are being drawn into a time warp!  I wish more ambience DVDs were like this, and that the manufacturers would indicate on the package that the filming process was kept free of moving cameras, zoom effects, panning, artificial filters or other gimmicks!

The blu-ray definition is stunning and the natural sounds are a big plus.

I have MANY other ambient nature film series -- some with better locations -- but you can't beat this one for high-quality resolution and realistic treatment of the subject. The film truly is unintrusive and lets its subject speak for itself without artifice or forced perspectives.

NOTE: Many scenes in the film are not of mountains themselves, but of mountain flora -- flowers, trees, streams, etc. But views of mountains ARE included, so the title is true to its subject."

It sometimes requires you to log into the administrator account to work, and then you find that once you close that you can then re-open it under the non-administrator name.  Not a super big deal, but a little annoying.  Also sometimes when in the address book the letters for the alphabetical choosing of names disappear.  You can guess about where the letter is supposed to be and eventually end up where you want to go.  Again, not a deal breaker to me but somewhat annoying.

415083,-1.0,2018,Its okay.  Easy enough to transfer VCR tapes to my computer.  But in order to transfer the .mov file to DVD requires a product key code and I can't find it in the packaging anywhere.  Disappointing.

415087,-1.0,2018,I was never able to get this product to work.  I installed it on my MacBook Pro with MacOS 10.13 on it and it just wouldn't recognize the video capture device.  After spending a ton of time on it - I then realized that it's only set to work on MacOS 10.5 to 10.8.  Finding MacOS 10.8 was a bear since it's such an old operating system.  I finally got it and then spent a ton of time getting MacOS installed on a MacBook Air.  Once installed it still wouldn't recognize it.  Customer support was pretty useless.  It would take a day to get back to me per question and the responses were fairly useless.  I finally gave up after wasting a lot of time.

415737,-1.0,2018,"It didn't work for me. It would copy 3/4 of the data from the affected hard drive and then hang for days. The display is not very verbose in terms of what the program is doing so you don't know if its trying hard to recover data or launched off into left field and doing nothing. Things like the display showing how many bytes of data have been transferred only show data in the gigabytes so if a lot of small files are being copied you don't know it until another gigabyte has been transferred. The error checking is not great. If a drive has bad spots the program will hang indefinitely. You would think that they would have put a little more smarts into error checking so you get notified that there is a problem with an intelligent error message helping you to figure out what is wrong and what the next step is. I waited for a week waiting for it to copy 1 Terabyte hard drive. The hard drives were not even spinning. When I finally pressed cancel it sat there for another hour and then just said ""General Error"". I'm sure the software works fine if there are no problems with the HD and all you did was erase files that you shouldn't have but if there is any issue with the disk this software is ill equipped to deal with it. I expected it to identify bad spots and recover what data it could. It did nothing of the sort."
415776,-1.0,2018,"Effectively unusable.  Had earlier version and found it to be user friendly and had used it for many satisfying projects. Had trouble installing new version (not sure if it was ever completely installed) When I finally got it to work, found it confusing and had to use many more commands to do the same as earlier version. When I tried to add text it would freeze up and I lost all my work. When I tied to call the few phone numbers that I found they were out of service. The program, the way it is now, is of no value to me."

My computer blasted through the upgrade in approximately 3 hours no problem. So, this being the ""Old Version"" of Windows 7, when the full process was completed, I got the ""Your PC is running and outdated version of Windows 7"" message and was prompted to an SP pack upgrade and ran it no problem, without a glitch. That being said, again, I had plenty of space and no conflicting software. So, for me, the software is working great and the computer is fine!"

Locked up my computer each time for over four hours and got no further than 13%. Cancelled each attempt. Finally just clicked install without searching install updates. Finished in less than an hour and was up and running. Took about 4 days of starts and reboots to get all program updates installed, but it was a more tolerable process. I fear upgrading to 10 from 7, but know it will have to be done in the next year or so. Hate this product obsolescence cycle, but at least I have experience with both 7 and 10, so shock will not be devastating but still a major pain.."

I left my first review right after the scene I mentioned above.  I just finished the entire movie and felt like I needed to revise this review.  The movie was more than I hoped for.  Danny McBride killed it!!  I won't spoil the ending but I'm so happy for Danny!  Lololol"

Love the new format, I had purchased an older version in January and contacted customer support to see if there was anything I could do to get the web based platform.

Would recommend it to anyone trying to find a good study system for the OAT.  The price of the product is worth every penny, unless spending another $500 to take the OAT again."

When you go to the web page it appears that each program is sold on its own CD and individually packaged. They're not. I thought this was misrepresentation of the product. It looks to me like they are taking the cheap way out and burning multiple programs on the same disc. If they do this, fine. Be up front about it. CD's are pretty cheap. They don't have to be."

I would not recommend this program, I am in fact considering eating the cost and buy a different one."

Was a having an issue with the backup not working and kept saying over the 25GB capacity even though I had less than that assigned to back up.  The lower level tech had me redo the install and some other basic things I had already done.  Then they finally escalated it to a senior tech and found out that supposedly the system was going through maintenance and to check back in two days.. this was after an hour plus of spending on it!  Obviously, this seriously frustrated me and then to top it off, after asking what they could do for me, they offered me 1 free month ($4 value).  Needless to say, I cancelled the subscription and will never use this product again.  The customer service was a joke and their internal communication needs improvement, if that was the actual truth of what I was told but highly suspect."

417895,1.0,2018,"My 8 year old has been asking to learn to type for a year. I have tried several other subscription based programs, and all of them have either been too basic, pre-school and none of them taught the way I learned. Most just tell them to type words without teaching the importance of finger placement. All that did was encourage her to be a fast ""hunt and peck"" typer.  I finally got tired of paying monthly fees for all these programs and set out to fine the way I learned, The Mavis Beacon way! I was thrilled to find this disk. My daughter begs to do her typing and by the end of the first lesson she was seeing progress. It works on a modern laptop with the newest windows software on it. (I have not tried it on my Macbook yet) The first lesson was about finger placement and doing a basic typing test. It is for children, but its not so 'kiddie' that its lame to an 8 year old. The best part is, I only paid one time and she can continue to learn until she masters the subject, then we can pass it along to her younger sister. When my mother and grandmother came over, she could not wait to show them what she had learned. I told my mom I fount Mavis Beacon, and both of them said thats how they learned too! So thank you MB for teaching the 4th generation how to type."
417896,1.0,2018,"We're loving this program! The kids typing skills are improving wonderfully! Fun games, music choice, can create progress for multiple users & disk doesn't have to be in PC to access program once you've installed it-which is a big plus for us also! Absolutely LOVE the large variety of Practice sessions!!! You or children can practice typing documents on interesting topics like History includes Bill Of Rights, U.S. Constitution, ect. Literature, includes like Huckleberry Finn, The Brothers Grimm & sooooo many more, Science includes numerous writings on Natural Science & Astronomy, topics include monkeys, bats, frogs, rain forest birds....the list goes on and on. I can see this program lasting us for years & helping our kids learn to love and excel at typing! Very very pleased with purchase & our kids are too!"

I Could Not Have Been More Happy with Dragon 9, which I used for nine years, producing over 7000 dictated documents. I had Dragon 11.5 available to upgrade, but I actually had an old computer that would not run it. I know it's not the latest edition, but I only needed it to be as good as the version 9. I got a newer computer and I have been using Dragon 11.5 for 14 months. I have dictated over 1000 documents and I can tell you that this product should never have been released. It's absolutely exhausting to use it. It can't learn anything. There are so many problems, but the main problem is that it is strongly biased to split more than one syllable into more than one word. That is the tip of the iceberg. I could go on forever about how bad this product is. I used it to dictate this review, so now I'm going to go back and make the many needed corrections. I'm surprised this product didn't ruin the whole company."

It leaves you in password hell with no way t retrieve a new password ('can't connect to servers"" it says when my internet works fine). I tried email optios to get a new password so I can use the program to no no avail. So I guess it's use it or lose it."
420759,1.0,2018,"I took french in college and was terrible at it.  Pronunciation was just be understood, but sounded American.  Did not have confidence and dreaded going to class.  Classmates that spoke already had a natural accent.  This program works so well for me because I am able to listen to pronunciation carefully, repeat it and hear playback at my own leisure, and privacy.  Spares the classroom embarrassment.  Best of all it works into my schedule when I have time.  And if I haven't gotten to it in awhile, I can always go back to refresh.  Finally a way that I can learn!  Thank you.  May even get into Italian after this experience!"
420760,1.0,2018,"I bought  3+4+5 as I already had some basic knowledge after reading Myrna Bell's book (Easy French Step by Step) as a crash course. I had earlier tried Rosetta Stone and some other apps but was not impressed with the teaching method so I felt I needed to try out something else. A friend strongly recommended fluenz and convinced me to fork out the dough.

I can testify that the tutorials and the exercises in the fluenz course are a lot more effective in helping learners like me (I'm Nigerian, Late 30's) retain new words, verb conjugation and grammar rules. After going through level 3 in just 7 days of intense learning, I found myself comprehending written French and being able to express myself in simple sentences. I just read an entire library of the Asterix and Obelix comics in French. I'm currently on level 4 but I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a fast and effective way to learn a new language."
420761,1.0,2018,"I received this for Christmas and I love it! My time with a laptop is limited, so the ease of using my phone to listen, read, write and test myself is something I absolutely love. I have had a few other programs but Fluenz has been by far the most useful and easiest for me to learn with. The portability of it just turned it up to an 11 for me!"
420762,1.0,2018,"I had already learned Spanish by the traditional method of high school classes and then living in Mexico for 3 months.

I am really loving the way it teaches. Try the trial and then buy it. You won't regret it!!"
420763,-1.0,2018,"I love the convenience of having both a download and the DVDs but I could not take the narrator and have been unable to do more than a few lessons. In contrast I have done most of the Pimsleur French courses. Having audio only is convenient for me as I listen while I am running or hiking, so I guess I am less likely to do this course but the real problem is the narrator. She isn't a native speaker, seems kind of stuck-up, and you get bored while she is flipping her hair and going really really slow for all of us idiots who don't already speak French. It is a shame because I think it is a well designed course but I can't make myself watch with this narrator."

420940,1.0,2018,"Love this product! Meets my needs perfectly! I am an associate pastor who needed a program for developing a mailing list for seniors ministry at church.

This program has some very useful features and is very user friendly, unlike many programs around these days which only teenagers can figure out. Fields can be chosen, eliminated, or even created without a fuss. One field is for birthday reminders. Enter the zip code of an address and the city and state fill in automatically. Categories can be created and chosen for mailing labels which are easily printed. I started with the trial program and after using it for five starts (the trial version includes 10 free starts and information entered is not lost if you make the purchase) knew it was the right program for my purposes.

If you need a simple program for your names and addresses, this is the best I know of."

Adding new names to the list is also very easy.

When I selected phone activation, the Office installation window said Microsoft no longer supports phone activation for this product. The seller provided a note saying to call this number (which he had provided) to activate. I did, and then opted for the smartphone process. Microsoft sent me a text containing 3 digits to confirm I was really on a smartphone. I then entered those 3 digits into my phone using the dialer. Microsoft sent a 2nd text with a link. I was instructed to hang up on receipt of this 2nd text. The link led me to a certain website. I entered the rather long sequence of character groups displayed on my computer screen (displayed by the Office installation dialogue box) into the website using my smartphone. In return the website gave me another set of character groups to enter into my computer. Office then asked me how many computers I had installed the product on. I clicked ""1"". Office was activated. I repeated this process on the 3rd computer, except when asked how many computers I had installed it on, I clicked ""2"". And then the 3rd installation completed and activated. Thank you Ani and Simon's Place for a quality product, and thank you for the phone activation number!"

423008,-1.0,2018,"I used to love this product until I upgraded to Ver 8.  I recently tried to create a Blu-ray video of a project - out of 14 attempts, the Photodex code failed to create a correctly formatted Blue-ray disc 12 times.  That's at least a 90% failure rate!  Sometimes the product switched out my thumbnail image for something totally unrelated and you only find out about it just as it begins to burn the disc - so of course it's too late to fix it.  Other times it ""says"" it is burning the data and tells you it did so successfully, only to find out that when you try to play it, no machine can find any files on the disc!!!  You turn it over and go WT...  because you can see where the laser did something, but no machine can read the data - they keep saying there is no disc in the machine.  Changes you make to the menu function cannot be saved, so every time you go to burn the same program, you have to re-do all your customizations!  Considering the price you have to pay for this Piece Of Crap, look elsewhere - save yourself a whole lot of grief and hair pulling.  Don't buy this!"

423195,1.0,2018,"Had all the roads and tiny village alley's of Spain.
DID NOT LIKE.  I'm in Spain for 16 days, using 12 different hotels and inns during a 2900 mile driving tour.  Garmin map knew of two of the hotels, the rest it did not.  REALLY?  This hotel (when I found them) were at minimum 130 years old and one had been a hotel since 1632.  It's not like hotels were built this last year ... several predated the American Revolutionary War.  Google phone got us to each and every hotel, and garmin took us to the village and street ... then google took over ... repeatedly.  ALSO, we went to 5 neolithic cave sights to enjoy cave paintings.  All caves have a known name for 50 or more years, and all the caves predate the last ice age. Again, no location was new and all pre-date the pyramids.  Again, Garmin Maps did not know the names of 4 of the 5 caves.  The one it did know ... pretty funny, it took us on a rough COW cart road for 440 meters to the back entrance of that site, and not the front entrance where there was a 300 car and 14 large buses parking lot. We arrived, but I'm glad I was using a rental.  By and large the garmin map worked, but certainly has not been updated for Spain in the last 50 YEARS.  Get on it Garmin!"

423348,-1.0,2018,"Product has limited activations. The description claims that this is compatible with windows 10. However,  until I found the right combination of compatibility settings the software would not successfully activate, instead it simply gave a 'please wait' prompt (I once left this 10 hours while I was at work without success). The online support page for this company is unreachable (Connection time out errors). Now that I have found a set of compatibility settings that allows the software to get past the 'please wait' stage it appears that the activation server believes that I have activated more than my allotted number of instances, apparently the developers did not believe in verifying that a limited resource had been successfully used, instead choosing to believe that all activations are inherently successful, this is poor practice. The required settings are Windows XP SP3 and run as admin, which would also suggest that windows 7 and 8 users would need to apply compatibility settings also. (Product description also lists these OSs as compatible). No matter how good the software actually for learning a language it cannot redeem the complete lack of support information, and misleading product description."

424097,-1.0,2018,"Program is much too aggressive, with potentially harmful results. Scan can take a long, long time -- in one instance, it locked up my PC for more than 2 hours. In addition, the app hogs all the CPU resources, so nothing else will run. Finally, it will wipe out settings you have set for extensions within Chrome. I pointed this out to the developers, and their response was to set an exclusion for Chrome -- but that means some stuff that should be getting cleaned is not, and there is no warning in the FAQs or help files. The version I originally purchased had fewer problems; a recent update introduced lots of app glitches.

I brought these problems to the developers' attention at asked for a refund at Day 29 of my license, but did not ask for a refund until Day 31 -- and they denied my request, citing their 30-day policy.

Not only is the program hard to work with, their customer support team is impossible. DO NOT BUY -- the free version of CCleaner is far superior."

They then had the nerve to send us an email indicating that the our issue #429653307 had been RESOLVED.  We bought the program so that we could file electronically and in this case it failed.  How about selling a program that actually Works!!!

426186,-1.0,2018,"Have used TurboTax Home for years without issues but in the past two years they have screwed up big time. For 2017 a minor entry error on my part created a loop I could not get out of WITHOUT PAYING ANOTHER $89.00 for a supplemental component. I very much suspect a scam here. Calls to the help desk just get transferred to an open line. I ended up printing the 1040, correcting it manually and filing by U.S mail.

For 2016 I owed a lot of money (for me) and they paid the IRS twice. The IRS does not like to give back money even when it's an over payment error. It took about 15 hours of work to get the mistake fixed. I will say that the IRS people were far more helpful than Turbo Tax who denied the error, then gave me totally incorrect information about how to fix it.

Bye bye Turbo Tax."

426484,1.0,2018,"I decided that it was time for me to estudiante espanol, so I decided to purchase the 1-5 set for Rosetta Stone as a download.  The positive side is that everything is broken down by module and focuses on grammar, definition, and pronunciation of everything to items to general sayings.  The negative side is that the drop off between the first module and the second module is pretty vast (with you purchase the 1-5 set, you're going to end up with 20 modules in all.)  You're probably going to have to do each module twice to fully comprehend what's going on.  Further, there've been times where the software has crashed and I had to use Rosetta Stone's support to get it working  - Not terrible, but there are some people out there who will be frustrated if the application has problems and they aren't super tech-savvy to resolve it.  You may want to get one of their newer products, but you could do worse than use this to learn Spanish."

I wouldn't recommend this to someone I didn't like!"
427421,0.0,2018,"The software bundled with this product (Roxio's Easy VHS to DVD 3 Plus) burns DVDs by default in a non-U.S. format (PAL) that consumer DVD and Blu-Ray players sold in the U.S. market are not able to read. There are no settings in the software that allow you to force the software to burn DVDs in the U.S. format (NTSC). This is not mentioned in the product manual or the manufacturer's online documentation. We only learned of it from their technical support team after wasting several blank DVDs. There is a workaround that can be used to trick the software into burning DVDs in the correct format for U.S. players, but it involves jumping through a few additional hoops that could have been avoided if the software had been better designed.

We were eventually able to finish our project without having to buy a different product. However, if we had known about the PAL/NTSC issue, we would have probably chosen a different product instead.

Here's the workaround in case you need it. After recording video data from the VHS tape:
1. In the Devices section of the Export menu, choose Computer instead of DVD
2. Open the Advanced Settings sub-menu
3. Under Compression, choose MPEG2
4. Under Frame Rate, choose 29.97 fps
5. Under Resolution, choose 720x480 or 640x480
6. Run the export process
7. Start a NEW project
8. Import the MPEG2 file you just created into the new project
9. Continue to the Export menu
10. Double-check the Advanced Settings to make sure that they match the settings in steps 3-6 above
11. Switch to the DVD burning menu
12. Burn the DVD"

I took one star off because the registration requires windows authorization after inputting the serial number of the product, but, the second time when I ran through it with a password when I could a couple of days later, it told me the SN was already in use.
I emailed the support team and they reauthorized the SN in just a couple of days, but, it was an inconvenience because that took us out past the 7 day trial period, which was upsetting to my son.

He and his friend who tried it both really liked it, so I'd recommend it definitely."

Changed from 1 star to 4. The company contacted me and sent a new camera (and some bonus modeling clay) free of charge. Excellent customer service. They are a small business that stands behind their product. My kids are back to making stop motion videos again.

My 10 and 12 year olds are having a blast with this!

My kiddos got this for Christmas, and two weeks later, the camera has stopped working. You would think this company would make a product that lasts longer than two weeks. :/"

This program only works with a select hand full of cameras that are outlined on their website. I made the mistake of thinking that all raw formats listed on their website would work but that is not the case. Their support team told me To confirm this DNG files are supported with the program BUT it still depends on what camera device that you are using if the camera is not supported it cannot open the file. This is crazy to me that a program would be designed this way and I actually think it was just an excuse so they didn't have to help me.

I believe the display is 1024x 800, looks small on a Retina scree, kicking the Retina down solves the problem with old folks (bad eyes). My 16 year old is fine with the lower resolution. The DT-1 software is more robust than Melodics and more bang for the buck (better graphics  representation of a 4 pad 4 cymbal kit). Melodics is free more up to date, but you must pay to get to the options of DT-1(free and 9.99 per month). My son has a pro teacher but will update this thread if he decides to purchase Melodics."

428399,1.0,2018,This is an excellent alternative to using Word as your main text generation program. I am a Ph. D. student and I am currently using this to compose my dissertation.

I highly recommend this for any academic that is interested in composing complex pieces.
428400,-1.0,2018,"Miserably counterintuitive interface. I bought it to work on screenplays and formatting refused to cooperate. When I went to the forum for advice, I was ignored. I ended up finding a free screenwriting program that works 10x as well. Giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because the book organization looks all right, if you can work with the irritating interface. Wish I'd shopped around before purchasing."
428401,-1.0,2018,"The actual functionality of Scrivener for writing is fairly useful. The reason I am giving this program two stars is that the software itself is POORLY developed. Here's why:

I have two computers, a PC and a Mac. I paid $40 twice to get licenses for Scrivener on my Mac and my PC. It's vital to me to be able to open my manuscript on both platforms. When I tried to open my file on my PC, which had been created on my Mac, an error message advised me the versions were incompatible. When I emailed tech support, they informed me that Google Drive doesn't work with Scrivener and that I should use Dropbox. After experiencing the same problem on Dropbox, I learned that Scrivener 2 on Windows is incompatible with Scrivener 3 on Mac and that I would have to export Mac files to the old format in order to open them on PC, and vice versa. Apparently, Scrivener 3 for Windows will fix this problem but isn't due out until later this year.

This is sloppy software developing. This program claims to make writing easier. In my case, it's made it much more complicated. I really wish I had just continued using MS Word and not purchased this program."
428402,1.0,2018,"Scriviner has a lot of interesting tools for all types of writers. I am still not using it for everything as it takes some get ng used to. All my old works are still in MSword. My new stuff is going in scrivener though so in time it may be my go to, but isn't yet."
428403,-1.0,2018,Don't buy this . It will not work. It arrives as a trail version . To activate it from the trail you must take the amazon code in the email to a website where you will be given another purchase option and then given a serial number.

428416,1.0,2018,"The things i like most about Ouino is that it provides two ways to use Ouino depending on the way a learner prefers to learn a language.

The first is a non-linear approach in which Ouino provides a large selection of topics the user can use in any way they see fit to learn the language their own way.

Ouino also provides a more structured approach that a student can use to work through the material in a more linear fashion. I have found a mixture of the two to be most useful for my needs.

Ouino provides a lot of opportunity to listen to native speakers and to hone your pronunciation by recording your pronunciation and then comparing it to that of native French speakers.

The color in the lesson presentations are vivid and modern making connections and contexts easier to remember between different lessons.

I have not found anything i have not liked about Ouino so far but I have only been using it daily for a few weeks so far.

It is important to use Ouino daily if you want to keep previous material alive."
428417,1.0,2018,"I ordered Quino French after reading several reviews. I wanted to learn something new, to keep my brain active. I am 55 and I am a beginner. My Quino Flashdrive arrived on time and in a beautiful, safe box. I installed it on my laptop. I called Quino's Customer Service to find out how to put it on my Ipad. The gentleman instructed me how to do it. His instructions were perfect.
My Spanish program is very easy to navigate. The graphics are bright and vibrant. The voices on the program is clear and the language is pronounced in normal and slow speed. I can decide for myself what I want to learn instead of a laid out program.
Tonny, the Co-Founder emailed me, to see how I liked the program and to thank me. HOW COOL IS THAT? I'll tell you, Super Cool. Quino don't just take your money and run, like so many companies do. They really care. I am enjoying my program. I also ordered Spanish. So you will see this same review for Spanish, from me. Thank You,  Quino (Tonny)."

429380,1.0,2018,"What an amazing program.  I have tried to learn Spanish with Rosetta Stone.  I learned vocabulary, but after completing Spanish 1...twice, I still couldn't conjugate a sentence.  The Fluenz technique is hands down so much better.  I chose German this time because my husband and I are taking a trip to Austria and Germany.  I'm on lesson 17 of German 1 and I can already write and understand the grammar.  And while the comprehension, as Sonia has said, comes a little more slowly, it is in fact coming.  I have never learned a foreign language and German is a difficult language to begin that journey.  However, with Fluenz I am really enjoying it and having fun.  I can't wait to get back to it EVERY day.  Yes I said every day.  One reason is because I am enjoying it and love the progress I am making.  But, again as Sonia stresses throughout the program, you have to PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!  And speaking of Sonia, I love the fact that she is with me every step of the way.  She's at the beginning of each lesson and at the end as well.  She's a wonderful coach and she encourages me to keep going.  It will come!  My only concern is that I probably won't have time to complete all 5 lessons before my trip.  I do however feel that I could already handle some essential issues, ie., ""how much does that cost? Where is my passport? I want to get something to eat and drink, etc"".  I fully realize that I probably won't be fluent from learning German through Fluenz.  I'm a realist enough to know that speaking fluently usually comes from total immersion for an extended period of time.  I do believe however that this program would allow anyone an opportunity to have a HUGE head start if they were moving to a German speaking country.  Thanks Sonia and the whole Fluenz team."

But since Corel bought them, I cannot recommend them at all. They are not as user-friendly, and I have problems over the littlest things, such as when I add a title the audio immediately following will cut in and out for 5 or so seconds. I've tried adding 2 identical audio tracks on separate tracks, and various other things, and it doesn't matter. The only way to make it work right now is to put a blank title screen above the entire track. Ridiculous stuff like that. It supposedly has all these great features, but good luck getting them to work without glitches. I could make much better movies with the earlier versions. I hate to have to learn a new program, but I just can't see buying this again. I may as well just use some cheap program, since it will probably let me do anything this Studio actually lets me do without causing trouble.

431484,-1.0,2018,"The Chinese language along with the Han Characters are amazing and beautiful.
Chinese is only difficult if you expect it to be like a Western language.
There is a whole lot more to learn and several ways to write it. It is not difficult with good teaching and explanations.

This course does not even offer an explanation of the written language. It  puts up Chinese characters along with Pinyin and tells us nothing of how they fit into the language.

There is no explanation of tone in the language. I think we are supposed to ""get it"" by blind rote repetition through the course without any understanding.

After I purchased this course and found no explanation for anything, I had to purchase a Chinese course from Udemy to learn and understand the basic structure of the language.

This course is just garbage. While I understand about learning language from context, in real life we have many, many different ""context experiences"" to learn the words from. This course gives us only one ""photograph context experience"" to learn a word or phrase. And hope that you understand what that picture means.

I may come back to this after I build a good foundation or when I have time to waste trying to guess the context of what it is teaching. ... But probably not.

I paid less than 200 for this on the Rosetta Stone website for a limited time offer but once you get on their mailing list, there is always the same offer. The download and registration went smooth unlike the bad experiences of those who purchased from Amazon. You may need a quality external mike to make this work."
431485,-1.0,2018,"Access code doesn't work, too confusing to use.  No help from Rosetta."
431486,-1.0,2018,"I purchased the Rosetta Stone CD Rom for Mandarin Chinese (Levels 1-5) as a Black Friday/Cyber Monday special directly from the company and I don't think it's possible to be more dissatisfied with everything! As others have mentioned, these lessons assume you have some prior knowledge or experience with Chinese (which I don't) and jumps right into difficult vocabulary, sentences, and grammar.

The basis behind it would normally make sense as it shows the words, pronounces them, then shows a picture and has you match the vocabulary to the right picture. I would assume this is how a baby learns language; associating words with meaning rather than a written definition. My issue with this, however, is that it is very easy to misinterpret vocabulary such as when it shows a group of women together and I'm not sure if the chain of words are referring to women, a gathering, relaxing, chatting, etc. I wish it would at least give you the option to see the definition.

In addition, since it was purchased as a Black Friday/Cyber Monday special and given to me on Christmas, it was just past the return policy which is only 30 days. I had a lot of technical issues after downloading this disc, but could not receive a refund or even an exchange by the company. The email support is very impersonal and seems as if they have pre-written responses. The live chat is rude and just as unhelpful. If you call, be prepared for a long wait time and then to speak with someone who has a thick Indian accent and can't even spell your name correctly. All methods of trying to contact the company directly were useless and a waste of time.

Rosetta Stone, by far, has the worst customer service and the worst return policy. You would think they'd have special holiday return exceptions, but they do not. Perhaps Rosetta Stone might be good for learning other, easier languages, but certainly not Chinese if you're a beginning student. Waste of money, time, and computer space. I question how Rosetta Stone earned their reputation with all these issues.

If you're buying this product for yourself, I suggest starting off with only the first disc until you're sure you can handle it. If you're buying this product for a friend or family member, make sure you give them plenty of time within that 30 day return policy in case they are dissatisfied."
431526,1.0,2018,"My experiences with Rosetta Stone have been outstanding. Reading over the other posts I understand why people become frustrated with technical issues. I have found that Rosetta Stone has patient technicians to help you through this process. As someone already familiar with Spain Spanish by heritage, I found this the most effective way to learn Spain Spanish (Castellano) than any other learning tool I know available. Being familiar with Castellano and so accustomed to classroom learning I kept second guessing the RS format. As the courses went along and I allowed Rosetta Stone to guide me as their professionals hav set things up, I saw the brilliance, difference and effective outcome in their method. RS has definitely done extensive research on how people learn. The RS method will not make sense to the classroom set. But, allow the process and you will see how quickly you progress and why it is more like a native speaker learning their language before schooling begins. I recommend giving thought as to what dialect of Spanish will meet your goals. Latin American Spanish is more easily learned by Americans. You will notice quite a difference in Spain Spanish versus Latin American Spanish. Latin American Spanish will come across much less formal and will have accents, there are also variations in words. Though I can understand Latin Americans (depending largely upon which country) when they speak Spanish, there is sometimes enough of a barrier where I have to ask for clarification. The fun part about speaking Castellano is that Latin Americans will identify it right away and it is often given status. With RS you learn which situations call for formal and informal Castellano--respectful and proper along with friendly and conversational. Too often people take 4-years of Spanish in high school and upon graduation can barely speak the bare minimum. With RS's entire-sensory experience I see people speaking more Spanish in 3-months than 4-years of the dry textbook. I have found it wise to keep notes of what you are learning and do online research when you have questions. A clear drawback I see with RS is the lack of a face-to-face/real-time speaking partner. Another drawback is that during RS tutoring sessions (an additional cost service) you're unable to ask question as you would of a skilled instructor. RS still has room to improve and better meet the customer's needs.  It is an expensive product, but I suggest  searching for specials or even used products to save $$$. I have learned you will want to invest in a high-quality headset. Consider the cost of a college language course. Having taken language courses in college, I see RS putting a person on a much faster track than college courses. Using RS along with a school course could be a definite advantage in excelling beyond your peers. As always, the time, dedication and desire you give will determine outcome. All things considered, Rosetta Stone is the best way to go!"

I have a vacation to Italy coming up and I purchased the Level 1 program so I wouldn't feel quite so helpless.  While I know I have a long way to go in learning the language, I feel like I've already built a pretty solid foundation for some conversations I would experience during my trip. I have learned key phrases I might need to ask or are asked of me, and how to respond and how to understand their response using conversational building blocks.

The program has been easy to follow and has kept me feeling engaged and positive about my struggles and success learning a foreign language.  I have been able to access the program on multiple devices seamlessly -- from home, from work, from my car! -- which has helped me stay motivated to continue the journey.  I appreciate the simple clear interface of the workouts and Sonia Gil's presentation of the material.  Each lesson contained a manageable amount of new vocabulary and sentence structure that left me feeling encouraged to continue learning the Italian language.

I'm glad I invested the money and I look forward to trying out my new knowledge in Rome!"
432339,-1.0,2018,Not at all worth the money. Primary focus is on how attractive the female instructors are. Flash cards must be machine and algorithm driven. Maybe the whole course is. Dont patronize this pseudo-instructor.
432340,1.0,2018,I love the Fluenz program!  The workouts are very well structured for enabling learning success.
432341,1.0,2018,"I'm only a small way into the product. I want to say that I am very pleased and impressed with how Sonia makes this easy.  She explains the language as you go and it truly helps.  Unlike other programs I have played with, this one is not a chore and does not leave questions.  If you do have a question, the support staff is quick to respond and is pleasant to deal with.  If  you don't get it at first, don't stress, it will eventually all begin to make sense."
432342,1.0,2018,"I cant tell you how much I LOVE Fluenz!  I have been trying to learn Italian for over 5 years, having tried Rosetta Stone, Berlitz, Living Languages, etc but none of them would stay in my brain.  I was surfing YouTube for some videos on Italian and I came across the Quello/Questo sample of Fluenz and I was hooked.  I love the slow pace, the way Sonia breaks down every word and sentence and how it relates to English speaking students.  Brilliant!  I have a girl crush on Sonia (the tutor), I feel the same way about Italy and the beautiful language spoken there as she does.  I love her stories, advice and recommendations throughout the lessons.  My best friend lives in Milano and I cannot wait to surprise him with my new skills.  I do spend about 1 to 1&1/2 hours a day practicing.  Thank you for putting out such a wonderful product!"
432379,1.0,2018,Has plenty of space for clipping things on and has a small loop string that you can tie things on to.

I contacted microsoft, and was told that this was obsolete, and is no longer supported, even the software activation will not work- so i sent it back, hope they refund 100%, or the credit card will..."
433016,1.0,2018,"About the time I got it, the company had changed their name to CLIP STUDIO PAINT, but the software still works the same despite this. Also you get Clip Studio for free for having the older version and copy of Manga Studios so everything worked out. Great program for comic pages and pin-ups. The reason it's a 4 star is cause you can basically do all this in Paint Tool Sai, you're just basically paying for all the extra comic tools, pens, vector layers, 3-D models and other fun stuff. Still the greatest thing I've bought!"
433017,-1.0,2018,"I've had this program for over 2 year's. I have done portraits and comic book's, all using a bamboo Wacom tablet on a MAC computer. I paid no where near 100$ for this program, I actually PAID 29.99$ so don't get fooled into thinking this is some extremely good and expensive program. The quality of the art materials is Subpar- it has amazing selection of materials to make a comic- but it's pixilation is low.
  If you have Mac IOS 10.6, 10.7, or 10.8 - you will not need an update for this program. But LIKE MYSELF- who has Mac IOS 10.11, the program starts to act up, even when updated . Especially when you play around with the layer's, it's all Janky. AND REMEMBER- I've had this program for 2 year's and that wasn't when it first cam out, so this is an OLD PROGRAM - you gonna have some trouble with the newer computer's.
  The Animation aspect is crap- You have to have a timeline so you can space out the time between panels when animating. Mine won't allow the Timeline to pop up and the folder's can add panels, but after the first panel, it won't allow me to draw and ACT'S UP/animation just completely stopped working for me. Also the PANELS ARE LIMITED- so if you are buying the program for animation, this is NOT IT.
  If you just want to buy it for comic book creating- It is amazing and worth 29.99$ for that. But the price is too much- for all the programs out there that can do equally what Manga studio can do for no where near this new price. NOT WORTH IT- save your money and go somewhere else."

433119,1.0,2018,"The original ADMS2900 didn't work at all....

Seems that I was the fault - the web site didn't specify _which_ radio this set up fit, or at least not as well as I might have wanted.

I ended up ordering the proper software (Yaesu FT1500M) and it worked perfectly."
433159,1.0,2018,Best product out there! Could not have done a business plan without this! AND the phone support team is AWESOME!
433171,1.0,2018,This voice set is probaly the most all round you can buy for the vocaloid 3 or 4 engine. His english while it is not bad it has quirks any bilingual vocaloid has such as R and L are usaully the same sound but his problems can be worked out if you want to spend alittle extra work. Also comes with studio one and piapro studio so its really a great starter and the only crypton vocaloid worth buying.
433172,1.0,2018,"It's very good. I do miss the sound of his V1 sometimes, but the quality and ease of tuning is great with Kaito V3. His English has some pronunciation errors to watch out for, though. If you edit the default phonetics you can really get some decent sounds of out him though (the worst offender is the short I phonetic, [I], which invariably sounds like the ee sound. I always replace that one with the short eh symbol [e], and it sounds much better). Wish there was a little more power to his Straight bank, but maybe if Crypton updates him to V4 they'll give him a Power bank."
433173,1.0,2018,Son loves it!

433621,1.0,2018,"I loaded on XP and began working with it with a tablet drawing Waco. It is a bit sensitive with the Waco, but with a few hours I enjoyed making a whole set of characters and humans to animate.
Placing them in flash was different than director, but similar. The properties box did not register the character, but the tools worked them and time line registered them and allowed animation. The flash froze once when I imported the character to library. So, it's different than director where all objects import to library first and then drag to stage. It's a quick upload of all parts.
There is no registration of product needed and it's a full license.
Plus gives a web view of 4 years of chat, forum, tutorial's and examples of the program and real names to contact if desired.
Coldfusion is a limited license to upload Dreamweaver and do a share design session.

433628,-1.0,2018,"The description (and price) led me to believe I was getting a machine that would make the conversions. Instead, it's just some wires and software. I've never used it; it's too hard to figure out. And of you have to have a functioning VCR for the videotapes, and the whole point of getting git was that I wanted to make the conversions after my VCR broke. I was completely disgusted with this, feeling that they didn't sufficiently communicate what it actually was."

433630,-1.0,2018,"I've spent several hours trying to get the software to recognize my VHS player and to install a driver that Windows would recognize.  I continued to get messages from Windows 7, Pro that Windows is disabling the device because.  I downloaded the latest driver and tried multiple times to get it to work and am now so pissed off that I've quit trying.  Unfortunately I bought it a long time ago and it's too late to return.  I just read a review that told how he/she fixed it so maybe I'll try again after I'm not so upset.  Even so I don't think that I could give the product more than a 2 star even if it worked amazingly well after the install problems."
433631,1.0,2018,"I bought this device to convert some of my wife's old VHS exercise tapes that cannot be purchased in DVD form. The setup was super easy on my Windows 10 HP laptop and I was recording in practically no time. While viewing the recording in the preview screen I noticed the picture periodically switching to a blue screen and then coming back in black-and-white before returning to color. Not good! To determine the possible source of the problem I borrowed my brother-in-law's VHS VCR and tried again. The issue was gone and resulted in a good copy of the tape on DVD. There were a few snowy spots at the beginning of the tape, but my wife said they had always been there when she played the tape. The moral of the story is don't blame the converter for a bad recording. If you installed everything properly, you likely have a malfunctioning VCR and/or tape. This device works great and is way more economical than paying a conversion service $20 or more per DVD."

434039,-1.0,2018,"The worst software I've ever bought. I've wasted tons of hours using it, I've been working in a graphic novel for about 3 years, and finally after all this time, I've decided that it's enough and I'll use another software. Here are my reasons:

1. Unless you want to use low quality images, it will probably work. but it becomes so unreliable if you try a project in 1920x1080.  It crashes even when you only want to zoom an area.
2. The text tool is just a nightmare. First, you can only use one font in the dialogues, you can't even use a word in bold like all comics use. It takes a lot to load, it doesn't support all fonts and if you try a complex font (like most of professional comics use), it will just freeze and crash. Also, it becomes unpredictable, like when you change the size of the margin, you select apply, ok, save, it just doesn't change it! When you have a lot of dialogues, it becomes worse because it takes an eternity to load and to make a change.
3. If you want to render a project is sooooooo slow, and it has the oldest codecs you can even imagine if you try HD. Just AVI and not bigger than 3 gb. No mp4, no windows media, not anything...
4. Smithmicro just doesn't care about you. Even they know they have this unreliable software, they won't fix it, but, they will still sell it. Motionartist is dead and no plans for making a new version.

Just for anyone who may belive it's my hardware, I have a  Asus gamer lap, i7 6th gen, 16gb ram, that works well and fast with a lot more complex programs like after effects."

434049,1.0,2018,"By far, the best Spanish program in the market today. I tried most of the courses out there, Rosetta, Fluenz, Memrise, Duolingo, etc, but the truth is theres nothing compared to Ouino. And the reason is because they focus in communication and building up vocabulary words and expressions. You follow a straightforward path they have created for the student, so you don't have to worry which way you need to go first. The course is extremely well organized and you can study at your own pace as you pause the dialogues, you play them at normal or slow speed, they teach you the vocabulary in relation to each conversation or unit. They intertwine grammar with conversation, and they create the perfect environment to learn the language without burden or struggle. Very well thought and professional method that I personally recommend anyone that wants to learn Spanish. On top of that very consistent in terms of academic achievement, as well as too economical for all the content being taught. To conclude my review in a few words, Best  Spanish course ever. I highly recommend it to anyone."
434050,1.0,2018,The customer service is AMAZING! This is the most helpful company for learning a foreign language that I've every had the pleasure of interacting with while downloading the program. This will work for the whole family! It's interactive and easy to use. Gracias Ouino!

434052,1.0,2018,"I am new to the product.  I liked the write up about it.  I have taken too many short courses, independent courses and such and the biggest problem that I had was that I would start all over from scratch and repeat all the basic stuff which I already knew.  This has a different approach and so far, it seems to work.

I only gripe is that my wife who is Mexican and speaks fluent Spanish tells me that some or many of the words here are not used by Mexicans.  I prefer to use Mexican Spanish as we live by the border.  I can speak Spanish and use it on almost a daily basis but I am far from fluent.  I will continue to use this course to the end.  I know it will help.  I'll deal with the vocabulary issues that I have.

Verbs and tenses are everyone's problems, I haven't gone far enough along in that area to even comment.  I will do that later and give more feedback"

She kept telling us to fill in information about OSHA when we were working on a HIPAA manual!

434677,1.0,2018,Rocket Spanish is setup very well and you jump into conversational Spanish right away.  The way the program is laid out is very good and it reinforces the lessons from the speaking to the writing in order to help absorb the language.  But like with anything worthwhile you have to keep practicing to get the most of out it.

Also, the lessons themselves tend to just ask you to repeat what you have heard, and only occasionally challenge the listener to take what they've learned in the lesson an actually apply it to make new sentences.

On a positive note I was pleased that the instructors would often add multiple ways of saying things."

I spent several hours spiraling back and forth on the phone between Verizon Wireless and Apple iPhone--the people were very nice, very knowledgeable. They made numerous tries to recover it but nothing worked. But the Apple guy told me if all else failed I should try a 3rd party app. So after I looked at some Amazon reviews, I tried Dr. Fone, and it worked like a charm. I now have my voice mail back. It's still on my computer, not my phone, but I don't anticipate that will be a problem. The one small glitch I found was that it was sometimes unclear how to close or how to eject this app, which looked like a drive on my desktop. Twice I had to use force-quit.  I asked it to scan for recovery only voice mails--the choice it gave me was existing emails, not deleted ones, but it claimed it could recover voice mails that had been permanently deleted, and it worked for me. Definitely worth the money. Apparently one has to back up one's voice mails (at least in iPhones) not in the iCloud but on iTunes."

The game cartridge is brand new and sealed, the box only showed normal wear I guess from handling and storing.  It works great on my daughter's LeapPad Platinum without any problems and no compatibility issues.  This game is not in the LeapFrog appstore and I was trying to find this for a year now for a cheap price and I'm glad was able to purchase it.

435393,1.0,2018,"I've been looking for learning programs for months now, and Rocket Languages has been the easiest to use and learn from. I was able to speak and understand words and phrases almost immediately. Unlike other programs, this one has actually made it easy to learn to also read and write in the target language. I can't recommend this program strongly enough."
435394,1.0,2018,"Ive been wanting to learn Japanese for a while now. Ive tried trial versions ofDuolingo, Rosetta Stone, and others. Rocket Language has provided great instruction and explainations so far. (Lesson 1.4)
Assuming that I can stick with it and get some friends and family to learn with me I intend to purchase the other two modules."
435395,1.0,2018,Everything it is advertised to be and then some....!
435396,1.0,2018,I researched several programs before deciding on Rocket Japanese. After only a week I can have basic conversations and understand bits of conversations. I'm very excited to see where I am in a month. So far this has been a great experience and has really helped my understanding of the language.
435397,1.0,2018,It's a really great program. I highly recommend it. It helps you with pronunciation as well as grammar and written words/phrases. I'm in love with rocket japanese and plan to learn another language within the next year.
435401,1.0,2018,"My husband and I were planning a vacation to Italy and thought it would be helpful to learn enough Italian to get by.  He started this program and and constantly raved about how useful and informative it was.  The proof was apparent in Italy.  He was able to use it to get around the cities we visited, ask about sites to visit and foods to eat.  A few times he would ask something in Italian and the person thought he spoke fluently and would respond in rapid fire conversation.  Obviously, he had to stop them and slow them down.  He was great and really surprised me at how much he had learned in a relatively short time.  He has now started learning Spanish.
If you want to learn a language either for a visit or for in depth studies, this is the Program to buy.  He also tried Pimsleur for spanish and claims that Rocket Languages is much easier and a more powerful learning tool."
435402,1.0,2018,"I've tried Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur...don't waste  your time and money on those, this is by far the best language program I've used.  If you want a secondary program to expound with, try Duolingo concurrently while you go through this, but if you are only going to use one, stay with Rocket Languages. I would highly recommend it."
435403,1.0,2018,"Having only been with the lessons for a few weeks I feel this is going to most beneficial for my need to speak Italian by February 2019. It is rewarding to hear myself speak what I think I hear. Also, being able to repeat it for practice till I get it fits into my style exactly.
 I have not arrived at the Culture portion yet, but the pictures are intriguing and compelling to have one wanting to speak Italian thereby making the anticipated arrival warm and somewhat familiar.
This style is self driven but the process so far is most productive and comfortable.
Purchasing Rocket Italian and now using it,  has confirmed to me it was the way to go."
435404,1.0,2018,"2 months' before a 2 week trip to Italy - time to work on language skills. Rocket came recommended on some web sites, so I tried the free offer and then plunked down the money after working the free lesson. Try it, you'll like it!

435409,1.0,2018,"I have just returned from my first-ever trip to China. For 6 months prior to my trip, the Rocket Chinese course helped me learn basic conversational skills that resulted in many compliments from tour guides, drivers, flight attendants, hotel personnel and other native speakers.

435413,1.0,2018,"For a long time I just thought Rosetta Stone was the one and only way to go to learn a language. Then one day I started looking around and came across Rocket. I was very impress by how the ways you can learn, I i'm finding it fun to learn German and I look forward to it."
435414,1.0,2018,Very easy to use.
435415,1.0,2018,"The Rocket German interface has been greatly improved over the last two years. I am very happy with the application now. I currently powering my way through Level 1 so that I can get to Level 2.  Almost there!

When I first purchase Rocket German two years ago, I found myself fighting constantly with the voice recognition interface. That is much improved. The practice the dialogs feature is nice.  This iteration of the Rocket Languages user interface is very good. I will probably buy the Spanish version when the time comes based on my experience with Rocket German.

My one complaint is that some of the exercises are too long, like the one on countries. But those are few and far between.

Keep up the good work!"
435416,1.0,2018,Very good blend of conversational and vocabulary basics.  The only improvement is that I would have preferred to have the basic grammar structure in the beginning but you do pick it up with repetition.  The voice recognition for pronunciation is really nice to hone how to pronounce the words correctly.
435421,1.0,2018,"I like this program a lot. I have it for two languages. It is good for learning grammar, both in sentence structure and formality levels.

The only thing i would like more is if you were taught more vocabulary right from the beginning because learning everything as part of a sentence can make it hard to separate words for me.

But i like that they have sections and tips and explanations to help you learn to speak the languages like a native. It let's you know why you say something a certain way and explains what each thing means literally while telling you why a native uses a particular phrase instead of how Google translate would put it literally."
435422,-1.0,2018,"I don't know how others find this usable, it teaches you with entire phrases and does not break down the vocabulary.  It is not a bad company, I enjoy it for Chinese, there is more vocabulary taught and offered in the Chinese version, so the Korean version needs a lot more work."

435712,-1.0,2018,"After YEARS of paying the high price of individual software items at hundreds of dollars each (Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, etc)  from the Adobe family of programs every time they upgrade,  which over time equals thousands of dollars..not to mention the dozens of people I brought onboard by teaching them the software causing them to become paying customers then Adobe comes up with this plan to rake us over the coals by charging a monthly fee to upgrade. This might work fine for people who work for a business or own a business that can budget for this monthly expense but my casual use of the software doesnt justify the annual premium. I have switched from Dreamweaver to WordPress for web site building and will pray for a photo editor to rise up and replace Photoshop...which makes me sad, but not as sad as paying a monthly premium for something Ive already paid hundreds of dollars for multiple times.

436965,1.0,2018,"I was able to put in Eleanor Rigby to Wavepad and then slow it down so that I could praxtice a harmonica part.  In the old days if you slowed a song down the pitch would lower. That is not true now...pitch is good even slowed down.  It is easy to figure out how to run Wavepoad.  I guess my review is about the audio program Wavepad, not the video, I did not buy the video."
436966,1.0,2018,"My video was amazing, I did really great with it. And the first export is free, sure I had to pay for the next export and that was fine. I wanted to cancel my plan after I exported it and I couldn't figure out how to do it. Since there wasn't any easy way to cancel I gave it 4/5 stars."
436967,1.0,2018,"I am using this Video Editor for small clips of my family. At the beginning it looked like complicated, but after several projects I learned more and more and discovered new possibilities to make attractive clips. It has a very clear and concise pdf Manual where I could find answers to all my issues. I still have to learn, but with every next project my work is better. It seems to me that both the software and the Manual are the result of a large experience. Also, I think that it is affordable. I really like it!"

I bought a new computer and tried to install it the software that I purchased.  Intuit won't let me activate the product because it's too old.  They're happy to sell me a new version.  I already have the new version.  I need this version to work with my client's data.  I don't need support.  I just need to install it.

Thanks for nothing Intuit!  When my client needs to upgrade, I'll suggest different software for them."

We decided the software was too old and purchased the updated version.  This one also has issues and at times looses content or refuses to save documents.  One would question, is it operator error?  We have three different individual working with this software and they all have problems on a regular basis.  If it is operator error, the software is not user friendly.  If the operators are not making mistakes, the software as too many glitches.  We use it because we have it.  In the future I will look for a better system.  On the other hand it was not expensive, I guess you get what you pay for."
438285,-1.0,2018,This was advertised as a newer product than what I had.  It is not!  It is the exact same fonts and program that I have had for the past several years.  This was a waste of money.  Don't  buy this if you already have a print artist. It is not an upgrade.!

438552,1.0,2018,Works well. Great antivirus protection.
438553,0.0,2018,"IMHO, antivirus software should not be seen unless there's a problem. If there is a problem, it should inform you what it is, where it is, and if it was removed. This software will boot you out of your work to share their collective wisdom regarding phishing and other brilliant ideas of theirs. And, if you don't stop and read the article, it will drop you from your work every day until you do. It claims to remove threats, but what they are is beyond the consumers knowing. While it does print out a hard to read report, it's from the prior scan, not the current scan. Click on the ""See Report"" button and you go to your browser and see a bunch of useless information. While it works as an anti-virus, (I think, I don't know that it's actually found any threat since it keeps destroying a game I bought and I believe it's the same to files over and over again), it in many ways acts like  virus itself, In My Humble Opinion."

If anybody has learned to get around their flash ads and closing the program without permission, I would love to know.  Kathy"

438903,-1.0,2018,It was an awful watch that doesn't even have screws where the batteries are supposed to go.  My thoughts are that they're trying to pull a fast one on people.  I bought this as a Christmas present and my brother won't talk to me since then.  Trash watch that should be discontinued.
438924,-1.0,2018,"Used to love this program before they started their subscription service.  My cook'n software ceased to start up correctly so I reloaded the Cook'n software.  Now I have a lot of ""duplicate 1"" indicators on my portion sizes.  If you have a question forget about it unless it is one of the FAQ or you pay their high subscription service fees.  Now when I start the software it requires you to log in and sync with the cloud with a warning that syncing will erase any recipes not stored on the cloud.  It is sad I am just going back to paper recipes."
438926,-1.0,2018,Don't buy this product.  It used to be the best way to store recipes but it has turned into a scam. I am about to go back to the older version that I was trying to upgrade.  In order for this software to do the things you want it to you have to pay for the monthly cloud service. It is so complicated and full of bugs that you need help and then they want you to pay $10 a month for their service plan.  Don't waste your money.
438927,-1.0,2018,"Same complaint as everyone else. Invested hundreds of dollars and time into the software (purchasing it for multiple machines which was required at first, paying someone an hourly rate to scan my recipes, etc)  and then they changed their business model where I had to pay monthly fees to be able to access my own content using my phone.  They gave me nothing for my loyalty. This is on top of forcing their so-called ""social media"" content and display advertising on the UI Home page each time you log in.  Impossible to make it go away.  UI and scanning functionality has a lot of basic OCR problems as well. Importing from a URL from a cooking website does not work well with importing ingredients, and it often truncates directions.  Most of the time I have to go find the original recipe online.  The forced social media content and bad commercial brand recipe recommendations the stick in your news feed slows the site down and is simply annoying.  Even with all of these complaints I still used it.  Final straw was I eventually I upgraded my laptop and because I waited too long to pay for the update on my previous laptop I found I would not be allowed to transfer software to my new laptop without repurchasing the software, meaning I can only access my own content with my old laptop. Their tech support staff is a skeleton crew.  The main ""tech"" person, Dan, has written sarcastic, condescending emails to me in response to my complaints.  A quick Google search on forums results in many comments by him using a similar pseudo-positive but underlyingly condescending tone.  From the tone and writing style he is clearly the one writing the pathetic responses to the other complaints listed here.  Their claim about having indefinite access to purchased software without having to pay to upgrade clearly is deceptive.  It is free- unless you get a new computer. Or want to access your personal content with your personal phone.  Run, don't walk away from Cookn'.  I now have my Internet recipes in Chrome bookmarks, including the ones I scanned into Google drive.  Works on all my devices, very organized, quite searchable. Free and Wayyyyy better."
438929,-1.0,2018,"Used to be great, have not used since the monthly subscription fee.
DVO support contacted me referencing an email from 3/6/2013 saying ""I saw that you were having some trouble a while back with your Cook'n software. I was just following up to see if everything is OK and to find out if there is anything I can do to help you'.
I incorrectly responded that it took until now to address the situation.  Dan, the owner indicated Josh called me within a few days and rectified my situation. I am taking Dans' word that this was the case.
DVO then offered to connect me and help me install the program for $4.95 and then monthly $4.95.  My response was ""No thank you, not looking for a monthly subscription"".
The owners response;
If you think I can afford to sell Cook'n upgrades for only $4.95 AND pay a skilled tech support agent to connect to your computer to help you install it, you are sorely mistaken.  There is no possible way that $4.95 (less than the cost of a hamburger at McDonald's) could pay for something like this.  We're offering a service, out of the kindness of our dumb ole hearts...and this is how you respond.  So surprising.

Good luck!

439251,1.0,2018,"I've used this software for several years, and am very happy with it.  It does take some time to set up inventory, and tanning packages, but any software will require that.  It combines retail POS with salon management capabilities, which are pretty powerful tasks.  The way it manages the tanning packages is a huge help in the salon; a big time saver.  You can't beat the price, either; I haven't found any other POS software packages in this price range that compare with Salon Maid."

439267,-1.0,2018,"I am very displeased with TurboTaxes way of explaining how to file joint for federal and separate for NY and NJ state.
Because of the way they recommended the work around back in 2014 I thought I was covered.
Turbotax did clearly explain how to separate the Federal joint amount from the state forms for your own portion.
Because of this and guidance from numerous Turbotax representatives over the phone trying to figure this out, NY sent me an audit for my filing which I had to pay $190 in interested as well as $980 in over refund received back then.

This software was full of bugs and did not properly calculate my NY filed as married but filing separate with my Federal as Joint.
I am sure many NJ commuters to NY using this software during the same year are experiencing a similar issue.

Then On top of all this, the download file in my library disappeared so that when trying to use the software on my new PC that didn't have the program installed, it was no where to be found in my account. After about 2 hrs of chatting/talking to Amazon reps, I was able to get them to provide a work around since this purchase was so long ago.

Frustration of TurboTax is all I remember now."
439285,-1.0,2018,"This download is not as described. Federal works fine, IT DOES NOT INCLUDE STATE. It is a duplicate of the federal version."
439295,1.0,2018,Works for us and we used turbo tax for years.
439297,-1.0,2018,"Intuit is an exceptionally poor company to deal with; which is a generous description at best. As has been shared by thousands of unhappy customers on this site and others they provide little to no customer service, hide any of their customer service contact numbers from the public and if you are lucky enough to find a customer service number; expect that you will never make it through their evil customer call queuing system  designed to weed you out and make certain you will never speak to a living breathing human with the capability to address problems or issues, no matter the causation or reason.

This company took a hidden fee from me by means of their own web site errors that would not allow me to successfully build the necessary customer profile to facilitate a credit card payment for the filing of an individual state return. When this occurs on an e-filing your only option is to have the state fee taken from any refund you may be due but alas they have taken a hidden fee to provide this service, in essence a fee on top of a fee, for the privilege of using your own funds to pay for a filing fee, all because their poorly designed web portal would not allow a customer to complete the steps necessary to facilitate a credit card payment transaction.

After 2.5 hours on hold, seven phone calls being dropped or rerouted to non-existent extensions within their company I have officially come to the conclusion that they have ripped me off with no recourse to obtain any type of resolution or remuneration for the errors they caused  which allowed them to take an additional fee  very tricky indeed.

Stay away from this company and its products for if you encounter any problem you will have no mechanism of resolution, which is the reason to use a credit card in the first place, to obtain some level of buyer protection  which Intuit itself will not afford you as one of their despised & whinny customers."
439305,-1.0,2018,This was the wrong year. It was 2015 & I need to get a refund.

The customer service agent from Amazon tried to convince me it was a safe download, however, I could not take any chances and requested the refund.  I am so disappointed."

Backup your recipe books often in case your computer crashes, or share them with friends so you have a second source.

Have put my previous-generation relatives' recipes in books of their own, and sent PDF prints to family members."
439389,-1.0,2018,This program is buggy. When I called customer support they told me I had to pay an hourly rate for product tech support. The glitch involves exporting to MP3. The guy on the phone told me I had to pay for additional MP3 exports and didn't believe that I purchased the full version. I took a screen cap of my amazon purchase and sent it to him. He is a smarmy puke and is looking for a money grab. Dont give this worm any of your hard earned money.

439620,0.0,2018,"So PC-Doctor toolbox is not what most might expect. Imagine it being like a website with links to support options directly related to your pc. This software puts links of many of the administrative tools that come with Windows in a somewhat more central location. It does perform a ""diagnostics"", although whether it actually does anything once it finds anything is beyond me. The updates it searches for, say for hardware, uses Windows update, unlike Dell's version which searches Dell support based on the specific based on your model. If your pc is already set for to auto update this feature is pointless.

If you know your way around Windows and can locate where the administrative tools are, this will be a $20 waste. For those who aren't very familiar, I would still say it is a waste. For those less knowledgable users, I would recommend a product like System Mechanic. It actually does something and has many features and options. Not just a magical ""diagnostics"" button.

439671,-1.0,2018,"I purchased directly from Aiseesoft.  Completely unreliable -- sometimes works, mostly doesn't.  Last straw was when it would not eject disc and no Mac commands would eject it either.  I will have to remove the player from my MacBook to get it out.  MacWorld, whose review I relied upon should be ashamed to have endorsed this product with a glowing review."
439672,1.0,2018,"I downloaded this software directly from Aiseesoft, not from Amazon.
OK, here is my review of Aiseesoft Blu-Ray player for Macintosh. I use an LG external Blu-Ray player on a MacBook Air. You first need to start the app using ""Launchpad"". Now select OPEN DISC. Select /Volumes/Terminator2 (or whatever movie is listed next to Volumes). Click OK button. It seems that you may need to be connected to the internet for the movie to start (very strange way for a for a disc player to operate). The player has a minimal amount of user functions, but there are occasional updates. Since standard DVD's seem to be going the way of video cassettes, a way to play Blu-Ray discs on Macintosh becomes more relevant. The new ""eject disc"" icon only seems to appear in full screen mode.
Final word: As long as you tolerate some minor annoyances, it will play your Blu-Ray discs on you MacBook Air."
439673,-1.0,2018,"JUNK.  DO NOT PURCHASE.  I purchased Aiseesoft Mac Blu-ray Player directly from Aiseesoft.  The product worked at first but their successive updates have rendered it unusable.  Will not load discs most of the time.  When it does load a  disc it churns for several minutes and finally allows you to start playing the movie.  Invariably it crashes and or freezes.  Its been unusable for months.  I've been waiting for another update to fix bugs but it looks like it's not coming.

Forget trying to get support.  And be prepared to be totally spammed by their constant re-marketing efforts.  I received 12 marketing emails in total over the past year and unsubscribed after every one I received.  They ignored my unsubscribe requests and follow through when I reported them to the FCC for CANSPAM violations.

Read their support FAQs - they can barely write a cohesive and grammatically correct sentence."
439780,-1.0,2018,I've tried and tried and tried but the software will not work properly on my laptop. It installs and if my laptop has been rebooted I can open it using the key code. But it doesn't track anything and when I try to view the log file it gives me an error and then shuts down.
439781,-1.0,2018,"I'm not sure if I like it or not. I just brought it, downloaded it and that was it. It doesn't tell me anything else.  I never entered any key words or entered an email address so the reports to come to ""only me"". Nothing and there isn't anyone to contact to help me. I downloaded this on the targeted computer and now I don't know what's going to happen. I don't want anyone to know I'm doing this.
I'm starting to feel as if I was taken for my money. If I am wrong, I will gladly apologize late but for now, this is how I feel"
439826,-1.0,2018,"This is the first review I have ever done.  I felt that I had to write the review so that no one else wastes money on this product.  Nuance should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a poor software.
This may the worst piece of software I have ever purchased.  It crashes every time I use it within 2-3 minutes of use.  I have tried to contact Nuance for additional support or updates and they do not respond.  I think they neglect the Mac users and only really support the Windows users."
439846,1.0,2018,"Great for homeschooling 2nd grade. Program allows for quizzes, practice, and awards for motivation."

439912,-1.0,2018,"Ive been using Mediashout 6 for over a year and I am sad to say it is a huge disappointment. Slides don't fire until they're clicked 5 or 6 times randomly, its crashed many times during a Sunday service. My computer blows their top tier laptop they sell out of the water but I still have issues. Their technical support is nice but my experience has been subpar (and I work in IT). Ive waited patiently for updates that don't actially fix my issues and not even Mediashout can tell me how to fix my issues besides saying wait for the next update which never works. I feel like I got cheated. Their product has more bugs than a swamp. Please just use anything else than this. It will save you so much time and stress.picture attached as proof I actually use this often."
439913,-1.0,2018,"I give up. Crashes are normal. I have literally never programmed a service - in two years - without at least one crash. And I am working with a computer supplied by them!

Many other quirky problems are very frustrating.

Tech support is helpful, but they have a bad product to work with, so ultimately their answers are not good.

Today the product simply wouldn't even load leaving us with nothing.

Goodbye."
439914,-1.0,2018,"We were a MediaShout customer for many years but finally have given up on this software. We tried many times to resolve issues and were patient with the support team but could not continue to deal with the problems and difficulties this program caused our church. MediaShout stops working and crashes multiple times during editing of the slides. Customer service was not good, never answered the phone even during the customer service hours and took a long time to call back. The tutorial videos were not helpful at all. The software does not have a user-friendly interface in general but is especially unusable to people who have no experience with the program.

MediaShout updates were sent out and caused the software to completely crash. We had to call customer service and were told we would have to completely reinstall the system with a new access code. The technician had to be involved to make sure we did not use up an extra licensing code when reinstalling. Each time the software crashed the MediaShout support team gave a different reason for the cause of it crashing. We were told the program was cloud-based, but it was so complicated and confusing to set up the cloud-based system we gave up and were not able to utilize that feature. Steep learning curve transitioning from MediaShout 5 to MediaShout 6. Opening the MediaShout program each day took a long time to load. MediaShout crashes when we try to add certain types of media into the presentation such as PowerPoint or images. Overall, the program was extremely difficult to use, customer service was not helpful at all and the program caused many difficulties for our church to run smoothly. We later switched to one of MediaShout's competitors."

However, Jason (one of their support technicians), was most helpful and was able to walk me through the process every step of the way. He was very pleasant and professional, allowed me to talk and explain my issues without interrupting, and we worked through the different installation process rather quickly. I would say from the time I called to the time we hung up was about 20 minutes or less.

Webroot has been my staple for all of my devices since I had a virus on my computer back in 2014, and for the time being, they will have my continued business. Thank you Jason and Webroot for helping me out! :-)"

I will probably never endorse a MS product in my entire life, but sometimes it's the only flavor the needed software comes in, so we accept that fact and do the best we can.

440702,1.0,2018,"It took awhile to get it loaded right, but it upgraded my XP equipment, so as to make my two lap top computer investments compatible with my on line learning network."
440705,1.0,2018,It's just what I wanted.
440738,1.0,2018,This is a good app although I know you are discontinuing this app. I hope that you are going to replace it with an app that's just as good or better.
440739,-1.0,2018,Im trying to cancel my free trial but Im not having any luck
440740,-1.0,2018,Constantly glitchy.  Hardly ever works right from iPhone app. So frustrating when you spend time creating playlists and downloading music for travel and IT WONT PLAY! :/ very dissapointed in Amazon.
440741,1.0,2018,"I downloaded the app as instructed and added music. It was quite easy. The Prime selection is pretty diverse. Im pleased and happy I don't have to spend money on ITunes. I was surprised to learn downloading Prime music is free to members.  Im sure Ill need to be flexible with what is available. So far, Im pretty happy with the App."
440742,0.0,2018,Doesn't work on my Linux machine.
440743,1.0,2018,Love it. Listen most every day while I go out for a run.
440744,1.0,2018,"Decent application. I don't like the radio-like ""stations"" as much as Pandora, but since I have a prime membership, why not get the most out of it.
It could also be that I've been using Pandora longer, so it knows my preferences better, but who knows."
440745,1.0,2018,Alexa makes it so easy to use so far the best music app Ive ever used .
440746,1.0,2018,"In general, it works well. It has some bugs and limitations - the radio stations appear to be more extended playlists than actual radio stations and they don't cycle new stuff in fast enough for you not to feel like you've been listening to the exact same songs over and over again for the past 2 months. On the other hand, there are a lot of stations and playlists to explore if you go beyond the ""recommended"" or ""top picks"" ones, so you can get a wider variety than it first appears to have.

It also makes adding stuff to your library very very easy. I have a ton of stuff in my library and I really need to create some playlists from it because it varies so much. If there was a way to exclude the audiobooks I uploaded that would work easily as well, but some of them seem to have marked themselves as ""songs"" not ""audiobooks"" and I haven't untangled how to change that yet - or if it's even possible to.

My main criticism is that the ""My Soundtrack"" which should theoretically be a personalized radio station seems to... have some algorithm issues. Supposedly it takes what you've been listening to lately and what you've added to your library to create your station. Which means I should be getting a lot of rock/hard rock/alternative with some metal and a dash of country and a dash of folk. But for some reason I end up listening to two hours worth of country every afternoon. I don't WANT to thumbs down the songs because I want to hear less country - but I don't want to indicate that I never want to hear that song again and the training behavior seems to have no in-between option. I've taken to fast-forwarding and the occasional thumbs down when I hit overload."
440747,-1.0,2018,Latest version is wildly incompatible with OS X 10.11. I had to use Time Machine to re-install the old one twice and then the app. update finally worked. AMAZON! Never impose only ONE version that works with your music service. I just bought a couple of albums only to find that you did not test the app. thoroughly.
440860,-1.0,2018,"I've used the software a couple years now as a replacement to Quicken. It has different usability and quirks, but adapted pretty quickly. It did the basic functions I needed. Then things started becoming more quirky. 1st I upgraded from v5 to v6 and have huge swings (many thousands of dollars) in the values of accounts - no explanation, but clearly couldn't accept these variances and wasn't about to troubleshoot this crap upgrade. I reverted to 5. Then direct connect for BofA outage for days - finally fixed, now having problems with Barclays US and my SF Fire Credit Union. I used download to get transactions - but then - so many duplicates. I'm fed up with the amount of work required to manage my accounts my accounts. Their support is nice and relatively fast, but who wants to spend so much time making the software work - or continually not trust that it's accurate? I sure don't."
440861,-1.0,2018,erased all my data - no one will help at the company. Do not waste your money

441008,0.0,2018,"After finally getting this downloaded, I was disappointed that this already assumes you know how to work with Final Cut ProX. There is no instruction on getting started - how to import, basic editing and organization. It has specific sections on corrections and adjustments."
441085,0.0,2018,"What can you say about Windows? Yeah. I know. It worked. No errors reported. This went into a laptop that I rebuilt and could not get an OS update for. Haven't used it much since installing it. I have, oh, five Windows-based devices of which three are consistently active. I have one that used to be Windows based but now has Ubuntu 14.? only (small HD). Of the five (or six) three are dual-boot Ubuntu of various revisions."
441086,1.0,2018,Good OS fo the workstations.
441095,1.0,2018,"It has been +3 years, and still running awesome."
441193,-1.0,2018,Overpaid and not enough of assistance to remove the issues that my PC had encountered. I went to a free product from another company after paying for this and it worked better. This also bogged down my computer and made run slower.
441244,1.0,2018,"This is a very helpful for a small Landscape Co. when presenting your vision tm your client. It shows them a visual picture of there home etc. as it would look if the project was complete.  Sells jobs you may never have closed.

441276,0.0,2018,"This product does what it's designed to do for the most part. I ordered this disk when I had to restore my old Toshiba laptop running Windows 7 due to viruses. Well, I ran through the clean installation process and little did I know that all of my drivers would be wiped (including the network driver) and I forgot to back them up. I ordered this disk so that I could install them without an internet connection and it installed a lot of what I needed with the exception of a couple network drivers. Whenever I tried installing the final drivers, it just kept reverting to a scanning system screen as opposed to letting me install it. Luckily I had a network connection by this point so I was able to reinstall whatever was missing using a free online driver scanner/installer. It's a decent piece of software to have in case of an emergency, but nothing I need to keep for the long term because I now know to back up all of my drivers next time, so I'm returning it. I will say though, that this disk should only be used by people who know what they are doing because the directions included with the disk once you launch the installer are not very clear."
441277,-1.0,2018,Disappointing

I constantly find that avast Internet security is giving me a message saying my router is visible from the INTERNET.  after contacting support for this product they still could not fix this issue. they just take your money.
441321,-1.0,2018,This free virus software was a constant resource hog and interfered with many other programs.  I uninstalled it after less than one month.
441322,-1.0,2018,Do not load this piece of crap.  It is nothing but a load of links that try to trick you into buying upgrades.  It killed my browsers by redirecting me to a spoof  Domain Name Server.  Fought it's removal at every step.  This is not the open source AVG for the Linux community.  It is malware crafted to look like a useful product while it screws up your computer then offers to correct it if you just buy another update.  This product should be banned.  I only gave it one star because there was no option for five steaming turds.
441323,1.0,2018,Very good.
441351,-1.0,2018,"this software doesnt work, the audio is non existent and i tried to use it in all possible set ups."

So after several tries, I finally got this program to load on windows 10.  I changed nothing so don't ask me how it finally loaded.  I still am not happy with this program.  It really does not work well with Family Search. I was contacted by seller to change my review rating.  The kinda told me how to fix loading problem.  (just let it run for a long time on Windows  10) for a long time and it will resolve itself. This is what I did to get it to load.
Still They say it should work with Family Search and it is Not a smooth use.  I will say however if you use Ancestry.com it does really work well with it.  My old Family Tree files do transfer, but with a lot missing. I did change my review from 1 star to 3."
441560,0.0,2018,This is NOT compatible with older versions of Family Tree Maker which uses .fbk .ftw and .fbs file extensions. This program doesn't recognize these file extensions. All my hard work is lost because Family Tree Maker isn't compatible with Windows 10.
441561,1.0,2018,way to go for records
441562,-1.0,2018,I was unable to install the program - and Amazon apparently doesn't refund.  I will NEVER get amazon software again!
441563,-1.0,2018,Software will not load to Windows 10. Bad choice. Not as advertised. Amazon should know better.
441564,-1.0,2018,Program will not install. Its not much good if you can not use it.

441740,-1.0,2018,"Looks like you can recover you data BULLS****, it scans you phone and will give you a print out of some of the data but if you expect to get it put back into you phone you are in the wrong place. once you get the print out you can re type it all in. For 50 bucks that is a real rip off. So beware that recovery does not mean reload of fixing the lost data. Just a print out of what was there ""Maybe"""
441811,1.0,2018,For the price it works fine for my needs. Still learning how to use but overall very happy.
441812,1.0,2018,"Good brand, Works good, Accurate"
441813,-1.0,2018,"When I popped the install disc into my laptop and clicked on the file for the editing software, I accepted the user agreement and watched it download, but it keeps giving me an error message every time. There is nothing wrong with my computer, it just won't register the software.

Don't buy this, save your money on something else."

441818,-1.0,2018,Tried to load it on my computer and it loaded part of the program but then it gave an error loading on the Movie Studio part of the program.

441836,-1.0,2018,"I have v. 10 and 11 which both work fine.  Thought I'd upgrade to 13, but the software failed to load, so I returned it for a refund.  v. 11 works great for me, so I probably won't upgrade farther unless I have to."
441837,-1.0,2018,Is not user-friendly and I want a refund.
441841,-1.0,2018,"Product is fairly reasonable for very basic video editing, but very inefficient in functionality, and very limited to visual effects.  You are likely to end up wasting time working with the features that do not cooperate well.  You certainly need patience to work with this software.  The user video settings get moved around without being stabilized or remain fixed in desired position on the editing screen.  Worse, the text screen shifts the fonts out of position when location attributes are selected.  The user font size selections will not always cooperate and the software reverts back to default font size of 48. Worse, it is difficult to position a font statement near the corners of the screen and away from the screen center. Some of the fonts would then get partially cut off out of screen view.  It became necessary to reset and re-type font lines over and over until it accepted desired setting.  Although the original video and audio tracks are automatically separated on the screen for editing, was not able to separate them to overlap each individually into other scenes, even after using the trim feature.  Finally, the software did not run on a computer with Windows 8.  Windows 7 and below, would work."
441852,1.0,2018,good for a beginner
441853,-1.0,2018,Horrible graphics and completely useless.
441893,0.0,2018,"Had to call Microsoft to find out the how to download the product, but it wasn't too difficult. I got an error that said I couldn't begin the download. I am alittle disappointed even though I should have known, it is only good for one year. At that price, it isn't worth it. I remember when you purchased an Office Product and got to keep it forever. What's up Microsoft?"
441894,0.0,2018,"I think this type of setup is a good idea.  It was not easy to setup since my computer had trial version that somehow initially got loaded instead of version I purchased.  I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling and eliminating credit card information for auto renewals.  Otherwise, Microsoft would have double charged me.  Delete any trial version on your computer before you attempt to install."

441903,1.0,2018,"Webroot SecureAnywhere is great.  I have used it for years.  HOWEVER, the version sold by BestBuy has a 6 month key code that starts on the day of sale.  When I buy a computer from BestBuy, I get one of these cheap or for free. So people are trying to sell them to you when they don't use them themselves.  Ok if you get 5 months left on the subscription, but many of these may be expired before you even buy it.
BestBuy should not be activating these as soon as it sells them.  I have had that happen and I don't even have the computer delivered yet. So blame BestBuy for the short coverage, not Webroot.  And ask the sellet how much longer is left on the key code before you buy."

441970,1.0,2018,"I have used this software for many years back when it was version 11. I'm actually using it to write this review right now. I have cerebral palsy so dictating using Dragon NaturallySpeaking is much easier for me. I would definitely recommend this to a friend with a similar disability or just somebody with carpal tall syndrome. I find that my writing in my typing with Dragon NaturallySpeaking by using my voice I was able to do things that I was not it will be before I've been using this type of software for many years. And would never go back. And has become a normal part of my life. I use it to operate my photography business and to write letters and email correspondence, as well as my marketing material was all all dictated using Dragon NaturallySpeaking. There is a tip think about what you want to write before you start dictating think your process all the way through till the end of this sentence. And you will get better results that way. And just so you know the more you use the software in the dictation to correct it mistakes it will get better over time. I rarely have to correct mistakes in for a couple years of using. I usually go through a one-page Microsoft Word document with no mistakes."

I keep trying to activate the program but when I enter the serial number provided by AMAZON I am told that the coupon code is expired.  This is unacceptable. I need a new activation code.

442896,-1.0,2018,"The product itself works fine.  The technical support is the problem.  The issue I have should not be complicated for the support staff, however, they will not respond to my request for help.  I have contacted them four times about this in the past 10 days and they have only responded with two automated acknowledgements that promised to have a support technician contact me within 24 hours.  I have never been contacted.  Two of my requests were totally ignored."
442905,-1.0,2018,"While I do like some of the new features, huge glitch that you cannot repeatedly save your work. If you save the work once, you have to close the project, then reopen it to save it again or else you get an error message stating the work has been modified by another user. Very unfortunate glitch in this version. I wish I had not bought the pack of three before I knew the repeat save feature was broken. It seems insane that you would sell software tor artists that can't be saved more than once. I usually save a work a dozen times before I'm done.

I don't know if this glitch was fixed in new versions. I'll have to investigate before I upgrade again."

443207,0.0,2018,"I purchased it originally because I couldn't afford Microsoft Office but, this program is not compatible with multiple text formats and can be very frustrating. If this is all you are going to use and it is very nice and takes some getting use to but, the problem lies in that not may people use it and the market and world is dominated by MS: Office. However if you are comfortable with the program and you are using it to write and print out then it is excellent for that and is very affordable. I personally write novels and use and flash drive so I take and conduct my work on multiple computers so unfortunately it isn't viable for me. However if you don't want to deal with Microsoft and every other corps stupid rent-a-program system then go for it. I personally purchase ancient version of Microsoft word to get around it. I have nothing against the Word-perfect program it just simply doesn't work well for my lifestyle."

443912,-1.0,2018,"I thought this would be a reliable piece of software as it came bundled with other good software from a reliable source.  The first time I used it it ate my Firefox settings; that time I was able to use the ""undo"" function to restore the previous state, and everything ran fine.  I didn't think too much about it.  But it kept opening itself and sending me messages that I need to scan for junk, that it was time to clean the computer again, etc.  Sadly, I gave it a second try a few days ago.  It ate my Quicken data file, including the backups.  The ""undo"" window was empty - there was no way to undo what it had done.  I contacted customer support and they responded by the next morning.  But their response was to use the ""undo"" function; if that didn't work, I should use my Time Machine Backup.
In sum, my experience is that this software is intrusive and demanding.  The algorithms that it uses to identify ""junk"" are not sufficiently selective, to say the least.  It gets rid of things I need and want, things that keep my computer running smoothly and reliable.  I do not recommend it and will be uninstalling it from my machine now."

444446,1.0,2018,"I'm going to start this review by saying my favorite piano for a while now has been Keyscape. The piano in Keyscape is just amazing, so check it out if you haven't yet. But I also wanted to try Garritan since everyone said it was one of the best. I went for it, and I've been playing the Garritan for about a month now. I have to say, I have grown quite fond of it.

At first impression, I wasn't fully impressed. It's a beautiful piano, yes. The room has a lovely reverb. But it still didn't quite measure up to what I was accustomed to with Keyscape. The Garritan piano initially felt both more distant and more brash/cutting. I like the warm, sweet, intimate tone of Keyscape. But I wasn't ready to give up. I spent some time tweaking, and what I've been finding is that the Garritan piano is remarkably adjustable. This, it turns out, is a huge strength.

The Garritan piano was recorded with many different mic perspectives. There are at least 6 stereo mic setups involved in this recording, and maybe more. There are also a lot of presets, and they cover a wide range of styles and tonality. If you take some time working through the different presets and the mic positions, you are sure to find something you like.

I found there were three magical adjustments that made all the difference for me. One is a control called Saturation. I don't know what this is doing exactly, but cranking up the saturation about halfway just makes the sound really big and full. Another control that I found very useful is the Timbre. The basic piano sound is a little brighter than I like, so turning the timbre down a little bit really helps to deepen the sound of the piano. The third control, and probably the most important, is the velocity curve. The velocity curve is completely adjustable, and can be shaped however you to make it. This is very useful. I have adjusted my velocity curve to give the piano a softer, sweeter tone, and this makes all the difference. Other piano software instruments have velocity curve settings too, but they are not as adjustable as this one. Garritan for the win.

It's a bit surprising that they included studio reverbs. Part of the marketing of this instrument is that they recorded the piano in a wonderful room which has its own beautiful reverb, making the need for additional reverb seem superfluous. But actually, I like this choice. Because the piano has both close mics and room mics, you can mute the room mics and get a dry sound from the close mics, and then add a studio reverb to get a different tone. Or if you mix in room mics and some studio reverb, you can get a huge, rich sound. The variety of tone you can access here is remarkable.

Some people commented that the piano has too much reverb. You can definitely get a more dry sound if you want it. But I'm finding that I like the space - the big, open sound. I have Ivory as well, and the Garritan definitely sounds more open and rich.

I was able to tweak Garritan to get a sound very similar to Keyscape with the Cinematic preset, which is amazing because Keyscape is pure magic. The fact that Garritan can get there is incredible. I've been finding that I have a preference for playing the Garritan piano. It's my new favorite. I have to say the Garritan engineers have done an amazing job creating this instrument.

I didn't have a totally smooth experience installing this. I bought the boxed version, which comes on a USB drive. When I first tried to install it, I got an error that a file was corrupted, and the install failed. But I contacted support, and they helped me right away, and after doing some troubleshooting with me, they provided me with a special download link to download a whole new copy of the software. I downloaded it, all 15 GB, and the install went perfectly this way. Apparently I got a bad USB stick. But they took care of it for me. So I'm a happy customer.

One thing that I found curious is that one or more of the notes have some noises in the sustain tails. Occasionally, as I'm playing, I hear something that sounds like someone shuffling or bumping something quietly in the room. It doesn't bother me, but it is interesting. I can't make it do that sound on purpose, but it happens occasionally as I'm playing, so it must be only a certain velocity level or something.

When first loading up the piano, or when switching mic positions, a sample set has to load into memory before you can play anything. This is different from some other instruments that I've used, where the sounds are available instantly. For example, Keyscape makes a preview available instantly, so you can play right away, but it continues loading the full samples in the background. Garritan makes you wait while it loads the samples. Fortunately it only takes a few seconds, but still worth noting.

I am using the Garritan piano on a late 2013 Macbook Pro, which has a quad core processor and an SSD drive. I am using Mainstage software to run the plugin. I don't know how this instrument would perform on a different type of computer (especially a Windows PC), but it runs great on the Mac.

The Garritan CFX Concert Grand is definitely better than other piano software instruments. Bigger and richer than Ivory. More body and fullness than Alicia's Keys, and also more precisely tuned. More organic sounding than Addictive Keys. Beautiful sound.

I am very pleased with the Garritan CFX Concert Grand. 5 stars, absolutely."

After I checked the invoice and re-downloaded/installed the software on three different computers, I could not activate the product. The error 3 keeps showing up telling me my activation key was outdated and I need to re-activate the soft and pay for the cost!
I wrote emails and called talking with Jeffrey at Iogo. I got/followed advices from Jeffrey: deleted/re-installed the software many times on different computers. Same error came up telling me that the activation key I got from Jeffrey was also outdated.

There is a little functionality that I miss from using Quicken, but I'm ok with that"
445183,-1.0,2018,"For simple checking and savings accounts, Moneydance should work fine. However, if you're converting from Quicken with years and years of history and data for checking, savings, investment, and other accounts, the import is useless no matter how you try to slice and dice it. If one tries to build a new environment starting at the first of the year and run from there, the results are mixed. Downloading investment transactions from Fidelity seemed to work - though an interest payment was booked as a transfer to the checking account? Downloading from Vanguard brought in transactions pre-dating the opening date of the account in Moneydance? If you deleted them, they were brought down on the next download again. The reporting facility seems limited. It appears as though you can generate a report over all accounts or just one account. I'll probably have to stick with the subscription model of Quicken or hope I can open Quicken 2017 after 2020 and manually book everything."
445185,-1.0,2018,Money Dance gouges you like the rest of them. You buy it then upgrade and they want more $.

It works ok but not  better than standard windows speech recognition unless you are a writer and really need the transcription.  the windows commands have more steps to accomplish the same thing and the speech recognition for dictation seems equal if not worse.  The help documentation is terrible and takes so much time to find anything useful.  If you must have this software I would recommend buying the book that tells you how to use it and then spend a week figuring it out and reading the book.

I uninstalled O-2000 because I'll be using Open Office anyway. THEN, DNS says, well...not yet. You need to download an additional Microsoft file. Went to the MS page for that and saw that that file was old and obsolete...but downloaded it anyway. Reboot. Whataya know...DNS seemed satisfied and finally loaded. I believe DNS 13 is an out of date program, but the price is right.

Seems to work with pretty much all programs on my machine and is quite accurate. Not perfect of course, but neither is my typing, by a long shot. I can see that it will take a few hours of using DNS to become really familiar with the commands but the time will be well spent."

My biggest complaint about this version is word recognition.  In the old versions they had you read a story by Dave Berry which was several paragraphs long. Pretty funny story too. By the end of it Dragon could hit about 98% accuracy. With the new version it luck to hit 60%"
445264,-1.0,2018,"I purchased the software with a disk, I replace my computers every 2 to 3 years and like to have the disks.  I keep the box and all material so I will have it if I have a problem with an install.  I tried installing it on my W7 machine, it wouldn't do it - said it wouldn't work with the operating system.  Bummer, but I was busy, so I packed it all up, everything in the box and put it aside for another day.  I just upgraded to a new desktop W10 and now have time to install.  It wouldn't install time and time again and gave me odd installation error messages.  Finally I got it to install and looked at the bottom of the box for the serial number to register.  Guess what - those codes on the bottom of the box - not serial numbers in any way.  Called support to request my info and help.  Total jerk on the phone that was only interested in hearing himself talk, wouldn't listen at all.  After making me do ridiculously simple tasks on my computer - he said my serial number was bad.  Yes - that is what I asked you for at the beginning of this agonizing phone call.  I tried to give him the info on the bottom of the box and he told me the ONLY place that has the serial number is on the cd sleeve or on the the cd itself.  The cd sleeve is missing and the cd has nothing on it. maybe I lost the sleeve in moving - but I doubt it had the info on it - as I hang onto those things and would have placed it back in the box with everything else.  He said there was no way to prove I had bought the software - I told him I had the Amazon order and could certainly prove that the software was purchased.  He told me that didn't matter and he would not take the numbers from the bottom of the box label. I asked if I could send him a picture of the label with the codes, he said no.  I told him I was getting frustrated and he said - Well that is fine.  I know have software that I have had for a year, won't install on anything and couldn't use even if it would install.  Terrible company."

This software is unable to replicate even basic sentences. Unfortunately, Amazon will not allow a return of downloadable software, so I'm stuck eating the cost of this useless code.

445574,-1.0,2018,"Disappointed after purchasing Quicken 2018. After purchasing the 2018 update, I learned that if I did not renew my subscription annually, I would not be able to access my data on the Quicken software.  It was my understanding, at the time, that if I did not maintain my subscription I would not have access to downloading my banking, etc. However I believed that my data would still be available to me. But, if I don't have the software I can't view my data. I have been using Quicken for 25 years and have a long history stored on my software. I am not happy about the direction Quicken has taken since separating from Intuit."

The material of most workout pants doesn't help. It's constantly moving around, so it affects my score, which I don't really care about, but I assume that also affects how many calories it estimates you burn, which I keep track of.

446455,-1.0,2018,"I have used Norton Security for years and currently have an auto-renewing subscription.  I've started to get an annoying add from Norton on the  Yahoo mail site and it's making the navigating through my e-mails very slow and difficult.  I have no way to get rid of it.  It's being inflicted on me though I am already a subscriber so there is no reason whatsoever for it.  I hit the icon that makes the add on the right side of my e-mail page go away and my e-mail navigation works very smoothly.  But the add pops back after a few seconds and again slows and stalls any action I can take with respect to my e-mails.  This is unacceptable and there does not seem to be a way to contact Norton about it.  This useless and obnoxious advertising, if it continues will cause me to cancel my Norton subscription though the Norton protection has worked without any problem.  If this review comes to the attention of Norton (and they should be looking at the reviews of their products) I hope they will review their obnoxious Yahoo add and realize that it will not endear the company to anyone."

Uninstalling is near impossible, and the program takes up the vast majority of my computing space no matter what I have it on.

If the option were Norton or a virus, I would take my chances with the virus instead, the computer runs about the same with Norton as it does when bogged down with malware."

I believe the card is still under warranty, but Garmin is almost impossible to contact for customer service. I sent an email last week and received an automated response that they received it, but now several days later I have received no further response. I tried to call Garmin last Monday and was told the hold time was over 2 hours. There is no option to get a call back. Today (Wed) the hold time is 45 minutes. So, I wouldn't buy another Garmin product if I could avoid it just because their customer support is so bad."

The only reason i give this 3 stars is the operating system issues. I got thru chapter 8 just fine, but when starting Chapter 9 the program started outputting ASCII code instead of the intended info. After a bit of research and uninstalls and reinstalls, i found that this is an issue on windows 8 and above.
The developers know this, and as such have a ""version 2.0"" of the app on the windows store.
However, there's apparently no way to use the code bought with this physical copy to unlock the full version of 2.0. I'm awaiting a response from the developers on this issue now, but the short of it is, if you have a modern version of windows, just buy it in the app store. It's still worth it."
446832,1.0,2018,"I  am very picky about my foreign language tools because I studied second language acquisition. I hate anything that claims to teach you ""like a child"" or uses other bad science.

I am still only in the beginner section, which I am using to brush up on the language since I am actually an intermediate speaker. However, I was a snotty 17 year old when I started learning Japanese so I wanted to iron out some things I had been winging it on.

I think the explanations on this are great. I like the flow and the organization. I would say that this alone is NOT sufficient practice. You will still need flashcards and some external practice. However, this is a great replacement for what a class might usually accomplish. And the price is really quite good. I also like the tone of the narration. It doesn't treat you like an idiot."

I have a lot in old Word and the crappy Word 16 that came with my 365  download- which was not worth the money.

It seems I have good access to the older Word documents (I was worried about that) and I will read  the help primer on this because it is a little different than what WORD 16 and  past similar programs-were like.

One thing- when I put the disk into my CD , a small pop up appeared in the right hand lower corner of my desktop- similar to when you put a digital
camera memory card into the PC but it disappears fast and you have to click on the Pop up-fast.

When it disappeared I asked Cortana where my E drive was, but I didn't get a good answer-
so I just opened the disk tray thing and closed it again and had my hand on my mouse right away to click on the pop up and then Everything seemed OK!!!!!!"

447008,-1.0,2018,"My family is very disappointed in this product.  It is difficult to install, even on a brand new laptop.  It requires the installation of another program called ""Steam"" and the creation of an account through Steam.  And then it requires an outdated version of Quicktime.  I had to contact product support just to install the programs.  When starting up Mavis Beacon, your computer will make you log into Steam first.

 Despite purchasing the ""Family Edition"" of Mavis Beacon,  my children cannot use the program at the same time on two different laptops.  This defeats the purpose of ""family edition"", which implies I was paying for three distinct software licenses.  This is very deceptive advertising.

Finally, my children actually hate the using the program, although they reluctantly admit their typing skills are improving.  Overall, an extremely frustrating experience."

447030,1.0,2018,"It does the job really well and I don't have to pay someone to do it for me. It is time consuming to transfer VHS over to computer because it is done in real time but worth it in the end. One thing I have noticed is that it seems to degrade the quality a little bit. The preview window of the video looks better than what the final video quality looks like. Because of this, I docked it a star."

447152,-1.0,2018,"Nice trick TurboTax.  Looks like you found a slick way to make us long time users of TurboTax Deluxe pay you millions more this year.  Your formerly good ratings are now in the toilet and I hope others like me will start using tax prep software from other companies.  If those ""other companies"" are smart and you know that they are, they will allow us to import our former TurboTax information into their programs in the future. I hope you see the light and change it back to the way it was and give us all a refund for this year."

447228,1.0,2018,"Very easy way of learning Italian. The program offers sufficient repetition and recombination practice in a variety of modes. As a former language teacher, I believe this kind of learning is as good or better than having one teacher for a whole group of students on the lower levels of learning. It allows each student to progress at an individual pace. Of course, there is no substitute for a real-life person on the higher levels when the student must create with the language. My only disappointment is that the earbud/microphone combo is uncomfortable and flimsy. Dual earphones with a microphone would be a better and sturdier option. I will be looking for a genuine Italian to converse with one of these days to pick up the necessary and authentic gestures."
447238,1.0,2018,Great Product!!
447239,-1.0,2018,Too many glitches.
447240,-1.0,2018,"This does not include mobile. You can use this on 2 computers only. It gives you a TRIAL with the first lesson. If you want to access it through mobile you have to pay the FULL $250 price AGAIN to Rosetta Stone directly. Also their customer service states that the Power PACK is an Amazon Product and is not supported through them. Just be aware you will be paying for this multiple times if you want more than just to use it on 2 computers. Alsonifnyour computer crashes and it was not uninstalled first, the lisence is still tied to the crashed computer and you have to request from Rosetta Stone that they allow you another single lisence Who uninstalls all their programs before their computer crashes? It usually happens unexpectedly. Good program but be prepared to keep paying for it over and over."

447375,1.0,2018,"Upgraded a new Blu-ray player in my new PC and didn't have software to run it.  I tried numerous free downloadable players and nothing worked, then I looked to buy one on Amazon. So many choices and too many mixed reviews, nothing was a slam-dunk and I didn't trust any of it. So I thought I would just call Amazon, ask which one they recommend (downloadable one only), buy it, download it, install it - all while the rep was still on the phone, and if it didn't work, get an instant refund and then try the next one. Knowing how frustrating the free apps were I figured we'd be on the phone for a while trying different ones. Not only did this one work beautifully from the git-go, but she transferred me to Amazon's Software Tech Support department (of which I didn't even know existed) so if I had any question on the install or use they could walk me through it. It was so easy I didn't, but it was nice to have them on the phone just in case as well. Pretty cool stuff!"

Wonderfully well-organized and paced, and incredibly well-explained, this is a MUST BUY if you want to start learning Japanese. From the writing systems to the unique grammatical structure, completing this course will have you well prepared for a trip to Japan."

447760,-1.0,2018,"I am very disappointed with the quality of the software.  You cannot stop the tutorial, in place, once the lesson starts. If you are 1/2 way thru a lesson and you need a break the lesson continues even though you've tried to stop it, without getting out of the file.  in addition, the audio and the video is not synchronized so you hear the instructors voice droning on but the video doesn't match. My advice, don't waste you money buying this defect laden software course; if you do you too will feel ripped-off."
447773,1.0,2018,This program is very easy to use. I love it. It makes me feel like a website builder professional.

447837,1.0,2018,"Upgraded to 2016. Required for full clone backup of hard drive. I have to reinstall every single time I use it, very annoying. Has good little extras. Cleans up things CCleaner passes over, meaning they work well together. I strongly urge cloning 2nd drive to avoid starting from scratch. I'm not even sure I can start from scratch for all apps now due to support runoff. The last time I tried to run the OS from scratch, Windows 8 preload, it failed. Acronis is the only sure way I have now of recovering everything loaded by having the 2nd clone drive."
447838,1.0,2018,The software works as advertised and I have had no problems backing up my computer.  I also have been able to clone hard drives which is very useful so I have a spare hard drive in case the primary goes down.  Great software.

447899,-1.0,2018,"I've subscribed to a number of VPNs in the past ten or so years, including PIA. Most are meh. A few are excellent. A few are terrible. PIA was meh when I first signed up a few years ago. Nothing fancy or sophisticated like the few exceptional VPNs, but a reasonable value. But PIA quickly started going downhill. As time went on their desktop apps for Mac and Windows grew increasingly buggy. PIA's programmers are inept. With each new update they just introduce more bugs and seldom fix the old ones. The Windows kill switch is unreliable and forces you to reboot your computer if your connection drops. The Mac app leaks DNS queries and even hacks OS X to takes down the firewall, something they did deliberately because they're too incompetent to follow best practices (they promised to fix it over 2 years ago but have yet to do so). PIA's tech support often seems nonexistent with support tickets going unanswered for days and even weeks. They've been confronted about it literally thousands of times on their forums and Reddit channel. Each time their only response is ""We're temporarily backlogged."" Funny thing is the ""temporary backlog"" has been going on for 2 years now! PIA is the bottom of the barrel for VPNs, certainly the worst I've experience din over a decade of subscribing to multiple VPNs. There are many more negative things to be said about PIA, including some horrible decisions they've made, but perhaps the worst is their recent decision to hire Mark Karpeles as their CTO. Google ""Mark Karpeles"" and you'll understand why that is one of the most insane decisions imaginable. Yes, PIA is cheap, but there are good VPNs out there with similar prices that won't compromise your security the way PIA does."

447902,0.0,2018,"Original I purchased this and was unable to use it.  You have to get a code from the private internet access website (which was blocked/some vpn websites blocked in countries) in order to use this.  I had a trusted friend who already had a vpn to complete the process for me.  Otherwise, you can't use it.

When you can get connected through their vpn, it works as intended. However, it does slow down your internet speeds in a VERY noticeable way."

447904,-1.0,2018,"This is a glitchy, unstable product, the customer service is terrible, and their business accountability/ethos is severely lacking. I used this service for a year with no problems.  Then I renewed for a year.  A few weeks later, I could not log in anymore.  I tried numerous times to work with customer service to address this problem, and they sent me complicated and convoluted instructions to correct the problem that never worked. I am a sophisticated computer user and I could not make their system work.  Finally, after spending a lot of time trying to work around the flaw in their product, I gave up and asked for a refund. One representative said OK and asked me to send him the order number. I did so.  Later that day a different representative emailed and said I could not get a refund because more than 7 days had elapsed since the order was made (even though the login problem did not materialize until almost a month after the purchase was made). I then asked who I should believe about the availability of a refund, rep no. 1 or rep. no. 2.  Rep no. 2s response was: You can believe the terms of service that you agreed to when you signed up for our service. I apologize for the inconvenience.

448592,1.0,2018,VERY easy to use and I am an idiot about apps. Looked several places and really like this one.
448593,0.0,2018,"It's not bad, so I sprung for the licensed version.  Creating and editing sheet music works well.  A major flaw, however, is not being able to change tempo in the middle of a song so that playback recognizes it.  You can put in the markings, but it won't playback except at the originally assigned tempo, and the MIDI file export shows the same problem.  I had to import the MIDI file into another software in order to do the tempo change.  I notified the company and they admitted the flaw, but as of yet it hasn't been corrected, and even for beginning composers and arrangers, this is a big problem.  The other issue I found is that sometimes imported MIDI files that aren't in perfect time (like when you play on a digital keyboard and save the work) the sheet music has all sorts of playback issues, but to be frank, this happens in many softwares, so I won't hold NCH solely to task."
448594,1.0,2018,"I find it remarkably easy to use.  And because the non-commercial use of it does not require additional licenses, my grandkids -- who are deep into music notation -- can use it for their personal purposes."

448687,1.0,2018,This is an excellent program for teaching yourself the piano
448688,-1.0,2018,"So far I have only used the Method CD and have not used the Intermediate CD as of yet.

If I were basing my review on the software itself I would rate it very high (This Changes In Update). The setup was a bit tedious since you have to download the program from the internet (CDs don't work with Windows 10) and then you have to make sure you have the latest player drivers, which is fine. The interface is very nice and I am using a MIDI keyboard. I really like the way it lays things out  and in actually very well though out... Software and Interface and functionality would get 5 stars.

Now, that being said... The music in which they try to teach is absolutely HORRID... Songs from the 1500's to 1800's is just a plain awful to play... No one has ever heard of it, no one has ever played, no one wants to play it, and no one wants to hear it... To me, the software is there to teach piano and in order to do that you must be able to keep the person learning interested in learning. By having to practice disgustingly horrible songs that quite frankly have no rhythm, are extremely dated, have no timing, are out of tune, and the beat is almost non existent........ it really makes it frustrating and hard to keep interested in learning..Then they make you play the same songs over and over just using different keys and mixture of keys. I could give you a long list of the songs and you would be asking yourself... Why.  As of now I am looking into something else...... Music: NO STARS.

UPDATE: 1/18/2018... So, I went out and got a Piano and a New Mic... I went through the steps of setting up this software with the acoustic piano and Mic. Even though eMedia touts this as being able to use it with an acoustic piano...it simply doesn't work with anything except a MIDI interface. I have made several email contacts and today I received this from their Tech Support.

""By the time a student is ready for Intermediate Piano & Keyboard Method, their musical ear is developed to the point where they don't need to rely on the software telling them if they've played a piece correctly or not. They can listen to the example and compare it to their own playing. There is interactivity, but it is limited to Lessons 17, 20, 32, 34, 40, 42, 43, 52, 53, 55, 57, 58, 71, 81, 99, 100, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 120, 124, 126, 128, 129, 131, 133, and 136. Since the software isn't listening to your performance, it won't be able to automatically turn the page. While mildly inconvenient, you will need to use the mouse/touchpad or arrow keys to change pages on a multi-page song.

You push a button then wait for something to happen.  Updating backups is excruciatingly slow.  I wonder if Amazon throttles the upload speed?  It appears the app doesn't index backups so needs to review the entire backup every time you turn it so before it actually uploads anything.

449268,1.0,2018,"First, who is writing this review?
I am a hobbyist with many years experience using editing programs such as Photoshop Elements.

My review will not show Verified because I bought this directly from the Pixeluvo website. I did so because the Linux version was not for sale on Amazon. Pixeluvo 1.6.0 runs well under Linux Mint 18.2 MATE with modest hardware. It also runs well under Windows 8.1.

The Linux version installs as a DEB (or RPM) and does not require a PPA. The software itself is different but the same key works on Windows or Linux installs. Minor updates are free when they come out, so the current version 1.6.0 gets free upgrades until version 1.9.9, but when version 2 is released a new license will be required to upgrade.

Before I get started, I recommend anyone thinking about this software to download the free trial version of Pixeluvo on their website. The trial version is is fully functional except it is limited to saving files no larger than 800600. The website also has full specs and tutorial videos. After inserting the license key the trial becomes the full version so no re-install is needed.

So whats good.
In short Pixeluvo supports RAW files, layers, and masks, and has all the basic editing tools: Move, crop, text, warp, brush, eraser, clone, spot heal, dodge/burn, FX brush, red eye, lasso select, box select, ellipse select, fill, gradient, undo, transform, curves/levels, and filter menus.

The capabilities and work flow are excellent, very similar to Photoshop Elements. Pixeluvo doesnt have as many toys as GIMP but I found its much more intuitive, easier to use, and faster. For the cost its excellent editing program and I like they support both Windows and Linux directly.

The downside.
Import options are a little limited. For instance it cant open PSD, XCF, or PDF files directly so to work on your old PSD files they must be saved out as a flat format and imported one layer at a time using the Open onto layer menu.

Saving options are a little limited too. The only native lossless layered format is PXU but you can also export it as jpg, png, tiff, tga, bmp, and dds.

Pixeluvo does not support CMYK. And as far as I can tell there are no square brushes, there are many brush adjustments but none make it square. In my opinion, all this is forgivable given the low price asked (about $35) so I gave it five stars.

Overall its a great program and the best option Ive found for photo editing for Linux. The Windows version is also good and a better value then Photoshop Elements in my opinion. I would buy it again and I would recommend it to a friend."
449295,1.0,2018,Great alternative to Microsoft project!
449296,-1.0,2018,I had similar problem to the other review.  The program would not launch because I didn't have Java.  I downloaded Java and program would never open despite trying all the typical restarts etc.
449297,-1.0,2018,"Downloaded the software. It notified me that Java 6 was necessary. Downloaded Java. Still getting the error message that Java was required even though I HAVE Java. Sure, the software is only .01, but can't get it to run so it's worthless. Deleted it from my system. I guess you get what you pay for."
449305,1.0,2018,"This product is a good substitute for Microsoft Office products. It's is actually a couple of hundred and something times better when you consider the cost involved. Although, I only use the word and spreadsheet applications."
449306,-1.0,2018,"I can't get past the Windows (10) installer. It keeps giving me a message that another installation is in progress. I've had no trouble installing other software, but this one is eluding me. I've tried re-starting the computer, checking processes, even removing the app and downloading it again. Same message. I give up."

The cost of the program is negligible. The real cost is when you can't get to all of those recipes you've saved and there is no one to help."
449348,-1.0,2018,"I tried the sample software and found it not bad, but there is database corruption error when linking ingredients.  Overall, the product is OK, so I decided to buy it.

I wrote an email to cancel the order a week ago and still have no reply.  Overall very dissatisfied with the service."
449349,-1.0,2018,"Do not buy this software here or anywhere else..  I have used LC since 2008 and loved it.  I recently upgraded my computer and tried to buy LC 2015.

My order has been ""processing"" for over a month. I have sent 3 emails and 1 letter asking for the registration information.  There has been no answer to any of them.  There is no phone number.  If you check around on line, you'll find that my situation is very common.  There simply isn't any customer support function any more.  The company gets an ""F"" from the Better Business Bureau.

I will be moving on to some other software."
449350,-1.0,2018,"The program is a good one and has worked well for the most part, but the customer service is absolutely non existent.

I'm beyond frustrated at this point."
449367,-1.0,2018,"Worst product ever. From the start, I installed the software and finished. It tells me to reboot. I get a green screen saying windows insider ran into a problem. then I try windows troubleshooting tools. none works as always. then using a Linux pc to look for answers I find that it is a recurring issue that may be fixed with the new release. well, I thought with Amazon I was getting the latest release. turns out rollback Rx has a $14 gold membership for free upgrades. but you will have to repurchase the software. so I tried to see if I can get a refund for my product. no, it is a digital download and there is no return button for any reason. so I cannot even get a refund so that I can attempt to try the new version without having two complete waste of space garbage software that corrupts my pc from the (MBR) master boot record from the point of install because windows wants to give a middle finger to the company that in my opinion has the best way to help them not completely suck with there troubleshooting software for windows 10. what a complete scam and a waste of money.  sorry for the rant but this is unacceptable."

449560,-1.0,2018,"Am currently on the 30 day trial available from the company itself.

It has imported my notes section, to ELIMINATE ALL MY SPACING

So instead of seeing census information laid out neatly, it took EVERYTHING and cut the lines off in the middle of words AND then tried to treat each line of type, as a separate ""item""....

ALL my spacing between items and my lines of dashes have VANISHED.

It took me 20 minutes to FIND the index.  No searching online told me where it is located.

AND by default, it does not list spouse, nor does it easily allow you to ADD spouse.  Eventually I did manage to add spouse but that seems BASIC!

Navigating from one window to the next is so far, way too hard. There are not back buttons or forward buttons that I can see.

The index, once I changed what the columns were displaying, is very hard to read as the lines separating the people are faint.

It boasts mapping.  So I tried it for a guy who came from Germany, went to New York state and then to Pennsylvania.  So why does this map only show me, one dot in Germany?

So far I'm mighty glad I did not pay money for this!  How did it get good reviews for ease of use?"

You also have complete control over your research,  it does not store your data anywhere other than on your PC, but you can share your data easily using gedcom,  or by creating web pages to upload for others to see.

449830,1.0,2018,Arrived in good condition as advertised. I use in Acid Studio.  There are some good loops in this cd.
449842,-1.0,2018,Not worth the purchase unless you like 90s nostalgia stuff.
449937,-1.0,2018,Doesn't worth $99. There are very few good flash-cards from other customers ... and you have to create your own flash-cards for which is much easier to use free anki for example.
449970,-1.0,2018,Needed to upgrade at a cost in order to get the better features of the product so I just deleted it!

449972,1.0,2018,"This is a VERY HANDY little program and I put it on my desktop for quick use. Instead of messing with Word or whatever, this little program opens in a heart beat and I can knock out a NICE looking envelope very easily and fast. Love the darn thing."

449977,1.0,2018,Product performs flawlessly.
449978,0.0,2018,Not easy to print business envelopes but it was free
449979,1.0,2018,Very good deal that shipped fast. I would recommend this to anyone with multiple devices in the household.
450001,1.0,2018,"I downloaded it from their website, it works as described. You can set parameters to your liking it's great. My IT department logs everyone out after 15 minutes of inactivity. I set the software to move the mouse every 12 minutes a few pixels,  it starts on windows startup and activates after the time you set, in my case 12 minutes. As I work mostly near my computer Murgee's Auto Mouse Mover allows me to keep myself in the loop and with my Outlook open I can answer emails when required and I don't have to log in and wonder if I even received any important emails that need a quick response. I also use remote connectivity software and can monitor the process on the PC it's connected to without interruption.
I can finally get some work done without the distraction and frustration of getting logged out."
450002,-1.0,2018,"Wish there was negative stars. This is the worst software.
I changed computers and the license is not tranferable.
The customer service is just horrible, No courtesy no hi hello sorry thank you.
Just one liners like Changing pc is not supported

Cannot beleive in this day and age anyone can survive with this kind of attitude.

DO NOT Spend your valuable $5 on this. Get a cup of nice coffee instead."

450063,-1.0,2018,You pave to pay them again and again to obtain permission print the checks.  Its too complicated of process to simply print blank checks. Its a way for them to get free money continually after paying for their software.
450064,-1.0,2018,"Came unusable and had to return it.  Invalid license code and it clearly was a cheap copy, not official CD."

450176,1.0,2018,"Probably missed a Q. or possibly my HARDWARE could only work with the packaged 10, but all I got was 10. I put it on a new build with Intel i7 processor, and I hate Win 10. I make it a point not to use ""nanny ware"" and that is all Win 10 is. This software installed like a bolt of lightning, but alas I didn't end with the Win 8 I hoped for. Maybe I didn't read enough about the i7 proc. but I would have preferred Win 8, than the i7 speed. Can't fault the software though."
450217,-1.0,2018,"The software is very good but licensing is a total pain in the butt. Anytime I have to reinstall windows I cannot re-activate the installation. I must contact support and wait a few days for them to re-instate my license. One is allowed two current activations only; say for a laptop and a desktop simultaneously. If one must re-install Windows for any reason any subsequent activations are disallowed The activations are not even tied to a machine ID, making it a total pain in the butt."

450339,1.0,2018,Gave to my son.  He loves it.
450340,1.0,2018,What can i say .. I love rootsmagic 7. I have used every software out there for family tree building and i won't go back. The customer service is amazing. The program is easy to use if you follow the simple rule of this is not legacy or ftm. I started too large and got frustrated. So then i started smaller and played with the program. Best buy ever.

450349,1.0,2018,"If your doing genealogy researching on the ""cloud"" network such as Ancestry.com and want to preserve your own copy of all the hard work you've been doing and want to save it on your own storage media at home, this is the software you need. I tried a few other popular genealogy softwares and I like RootsMagic the best. The main reason why I feel it's the best, is that when you sync you Ancestry.com tree to your RootsMagic program, all of the media you've collected will be saved also. By ""media"" I mean, photos, and documents will be saved also."
450351,-1.0,2018,"Reviews stated RM was compatible with Ancestry.com - you can only export to but, can not import from Ancestry.com"

450383,1.0,2018,Must have easy to use
450386,-1.0,2018,This is a flash program not a PDF! This completely defeats the purpose of an electronic book for me. I load manuals to google drive so I can access them from any of my shops. And I like to print out certain pages so I can get them dirty and just toss them when done. I should have noticed that this was not a PDF but I assumed that it was like all the other electronic manuals you find online.
450396,-1.0,2018,invalid license after a few months.
450406,-1.0,2018,"Its pretty disappointing that Amazon wouldnt let me post my first and very simple review of this product despite following their guideline of focusing on specific features of the product and your experience with it. This product only gave me access to 1 out of the 43 chapters, thus making this purchase and my experience with it VERY unsatisfying and without much to go off of."
450418,1.0,2018,Good reference material at a fair price.  Thanks
450427,1.0,2018,"Wow! Just simply wow! The graphics are amazing, the adjustable speed function is so helpful and easy to follow! I suggest the product to those who are studying taekwondo and need that extra boost of help without paying for expensive private lessons."
450428,0.0,2018,"I was expecting an actual breakdown of the forms. Instead it's an animated athlete doing the entire form. You can slow it down, zoom in, pause, and change views, which makes this unique, but I wasn't able to practice my form without using the Wtf Poomsae handbook as an additional supplement. Not a bad tool for the price, but I get more out of the book and DVDs which break them down step by step (while naming each step) than I do from this CD."

450450,-1.0,2018,Didn't work on my phone.
450451,-1.0,2018,I have no idea why I downloaded this bit of software. Now it is a possible Malware/adware infestation. Take time out to scan and remove that. Oh and the program did not install at all. I assumed the antivirus kicked the installation out. Amazon needs to remove this from their inventory.
450465,1.0,2018,"I was wary because of the price, but bought it anyway. Im an old guy but sort of a beginning shooter who pretty much cant hit the side of a barn.
This guy starts with a two hour video on grip and stance which I found very informative. The second video is devoted to the how and why of dry fire practice. Also very informative. The third is how to deal with personal physical issues. I haven't watched all of that yet.
Ive watched a good slug of YouTube vids on these subjects. Many are very good, but designed more for people who aren't beginners.
This guy takes you through slowly and, obviously, you can watch it again. Some YouTube people have different ideas than this guy. So what?
Any newbie will benefit from this. My range wants $100 for basic training. I may do that, but this gives you a good starting point before you move on."
450466,0.0,2018,All good except disc 2 a waste.
450467,1.0,2018,Very comprehensive program that starts with the basics and provides clear instruction to becoming a consistantly accurate shooter.

Was great though to be able to take the course commpletely and be sent the certificate so it was enough for the DMV Glad we purchased it and child did the course. Easier to focus when not in a class room setting"
450581,1.0,2018,"Was delighted with the product and the time frame in which it was delivered.
Better than having to deal with Windows XP."
450591,-1.0,2018,"This would be a really nice program, if only it would activate.. Works wonderfully during the 30-day trial period, but the supplied code will not activate it . Multiple emails to support@o'print have gone unanswered. It is extremely frustrating to find a program that does just what you want, but that will not run past the trial period, and the purchased activation code is no good."
450620,-1.0,2018,the sound quality in the install was not the same as the original still had problem on the internet keep getting security alerts to many pop ups overall did not worked as aspected

450622,1.0,2018,"Did exactly what I needed it to do... aka I wiped an old dinosaur computer, didn't have the original disk. This worked perfectly. Takes about an hour but its like a brand new fossil."
450623,1.0,2018,The Tech Guru that fixed it said it worked LIKE A CHAMP!! And the Toshiba back-up captured 'EVERYTHING' so when I got the CPU back it was like nothing ever happened. In my world that is a win-win outcome.

450630,-1.0,2018,"I followed the online directions for both the boot repair in BIOS and attempted Windows repairing and neither worked. The only thing the disc seemed to want to do was a re-installation, which I did not want (as it would have erased everything I had on there). If someone wants to reinstall and start fresh, this will work. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
450644,1.0,2018,I am so impressed with AceOrganic Chemistry.com and this CD. I am tutoring a college student and this program has been an amazing help! Mike sent me the download right after I ordered it-he has been super helpful. My student assures me this has added to her success in class. The Flash Cards and information included is incredible. The two E-book downloads are an added plus. It is presented in an easy to understand format and is easy to use. I highly recommend this proghram to anyone wanting a better understanding of Organic Chemistry. Pass Organic Chemistry with E. A. S. E. just follow the format presented and you will succeed!
450645,1.0,2018,Very concise and easy to understand.
450646,0.0,2018,I feel like this CD contains a lot of content from Organic Chemistry 1 and not so much from Organic Chemistry 2 which is what I needed it for. So I'd definetly recommend it if you are taking Orgo 1.... for Orgo 2 you'd probably want to look somewhere else..
450647,1.0,2018,"I'd love this CD...it could clear many doubts that I have had at university! The videos are amazing and very clear and the flashcards usefull too. If I had had this material when I was at University, it would've been easier than it was. Now, it's helping me a lot when I need teaching some issues.
Buy it!"

450657,-1.0,2018,This program gave six options which could never have been any of my passwords or anything near the style of passwords I use. In fact it gave the same six options on each of my 4 email accounts or PST files. How is that possible if this product really worked? Want money back. I should have paid attention to the only other product review which was like this review. My bad.
450658,-1.0,2018,did not find my passwords
450659,-1.0,2018,It don't fit phone right and it's made poorly
450691,1.0,2018,The price is right and it's a pretty engaging application. Wish there were more levels and maybe a speed round to challenge a bit more.
450706,1.0,2018,"I missed this show when it was originally telecast. I got it because I am interested in history in general, and the 1920s in particular. Everything works! The staging, costumes and sets, as well as the cars and music are 100% authentic. The development of organized crime in this country is particularly well depicted, from the suave Arnold Rothstein to Luciano and Lansky. One thing I really liked was the development of the characters of Lansky and Luciano from young and brash to older, colder and more lethal.

Acting is so good that it is easy to forget that this is a fictionalized version of history However, this is not for the sensitive or squeamish: the violence is graphic and so is the sex. These things don't trouble me, because they are part of human nature and part of the ""Roaring Twenties"".

Disc quality is perfect; sound is crisp and clear.

Perfect for binge watching. I suspect a second watching is in the near future, because it is that good!"
450707,1.0,2018,"Loved this story telling of greed, lust and love of craziness. At end more up to date history should have explained the gangster."
450708,-1.0,2018,This is possibly the most boring show Ive ever watched. Ive only seen five episodes so I could be totally off but Ive given up watching any further.
450709,-1.0,2018,One disc was cracked and another just didn't work. Was sent a refund but come on man right in the middle of the series. Had to go on line to watch the rest of the series.
450710,1.0,2018,I've watched the series already and wanted the bluray disks to see it in high quality well worth it. I'm obsessed with gangster era stuff and this series hits it right on the head.

450712,-1.0,2018,"5 of the dvd's don't play, i should have checked them when the order came instead of waiting until it starting watching them"
450713,1.0,2018,"Love this series. I think it must have been returned. There were finger prints on some of the CD's but only one episode skipped in two different scenes. The series came in a box but none of them were wrapped, this is why I think it was returned. I'm keeping my set. Well worth the money. If you like Steve Buscemi you will love this series its a must buy."

450773,-1.0,2018,"It's great that they offer unlimited space and the app interface is actually decent for backing. However, the app is buggy as all heck and eats cpu. It can basically chew up all the cpu on a Mid 2014 maxed out Macbook pro or a recent loaded windows laptop. Don't know what it's doing but it seems to have been written by someone who failed their algorithms class. CPU usage grows seemingly exponentially with number of files and depth of directory trees. It's been around for a long, long time so it is frankly unforgivable that it's this bad. If they fixed this it would be absolutely awesome. Given that Amazon seems unable to write an app that actually works they should really enable an API so someone who knows how to write a native app that actually works can write one. This would be far more helpful than the condescending ""support"" they provide on various forums asking people to restart they computer etc and ensure their computer is up to snuff. On the other hand maybe this behavior is deliberate because they don't actually want to provide unlimited anything."
450774,-1.0,2018,"I set up my drive account because of the unlimited photo storage option for Prime members.  It does store my photos, so there's that.  But its process of capturing and tracking what files are backed up seems to involve using RAM, and if you have a large number of files or photos, it will eventually take over your RAM and crash your machine.  If you restart the machine, you get your RAM back, but it starts over with the backup process which means it never quite finishes getting through your files and never manages to get everything backed up.  Other backup solutions solve this problem by writing some sort of information to disk so they can minimize RAM usage and can pick up where they left off after a restart.  Having finally figured out that this is the program that's regularly crashing my machine, I'm now going to have to find a different backup solution and start over with getting everything backed up, which is frustrating."
450776,1.0,2018,Ok
450777,-1.0,2018,"Recently, I find my Mac Book Pro fan runs all the time and battery life is very short.  Thinking back, the timing corresponds to an 'Over Quota"" message.  Tracking back through Activity Monitor, I see a very hungry Amazon Drive.  Something is flawed.  I'll be the first to admit, it might be my understanding, but I've been using Amazon Drive for a couple of years (since the beginning?) and now it is not cooperating.

I just now paused the Amazon Drive app and the fan is quiet and the battery is charging nicely.  Seriously weighing the costs to use a ""free"" Amazon Drive versus removing it."
450778,-1.0,2018,"It syncs well enough.

But it's an absolute CPU hoarder. Battery life will decrease drastically while the temperature will climb high sky.

450944,-1.0,2018,"This is not what I thought I was purchasing. Using ""The Print Shop"" name is very misleading. What I was looking for was ""The Print Shop for Mac - Version 4"". What I ended up getting was an Encore version which is not compatible with ""The Print Shop - Version 3"" program I already had. As this item is nonrefundable and nonreturnable, I'm left with a program I don't really want and am out $50.00. Not only that, this new program is listed as ""the latest"" and upon receipt I learned the Mac SE is a computer that we had around 30 years ago."
450945,-1.0,2018,Unable to install because it is not Apple certified and it will not open.  It is a security issue.  I am leery of this product and do not want to risk my computer's security.  That is what makes Apple an Apple product.  The item I purchased states that it is for Mac but failed to mention not approved by make.
450946,-1.0,2018,"We had an older version of the Print Shop on an aging PC, ;and had a rush project we wished to do on a MAC so we purchased the download.  Big mistake!  We ended up doing the project on the old PC with the old software.  The attempt to use the new software only delayed our work and added a great deal of frustration.

1.  There were no decent instructions on how to use it.  In stead of doing a tutorial (e.g. A, B, C, ..., they offered very brief videos that went like A, Z. - end of story ).
2.  We wished to send a sample of our work via eMail, but the format was not JPEG, but something that could not be opened by anyone unless they had the same program.
3.  We attempted to print our work (it looked fine on Print Preview), but it was blown up in size on the printer and could net be used.
4.  We therefore did the project on the old PC, as mentioned.

Do yourself a kindness and avoid this software."
450951,-1.0,2018,I agree with other reviews.  I have been using Printshop for over 10 years and this version is horrible.  Not user friendly at all.

450953,-1.0,2018,"I have been using Print Shop for years, but this version was extremely difficult to use. Cannot understand why.

450954,-1.0,2018,"Wow, I have been using The Print Shop since Broderbund's Apple ][ version and I have to say this was worst software experience I have ever had. I have also been using Amazon since 1995 and have never had an experience so bad I felt compelled to write a review. Shame on Broderbund, Encore, and Amazon.

This is not new for Mac; it appears to be a poorly done 2015 port of an older Windows version to OS X. For example, browsing folders in the open and save dialogs does not work. Something simple like adding a border to a picture was not possible, etc., etc. I could not remove it fast enough. Of course, not being a real Mac application it does not know how to remove itself so I had to use AppCleaner. We purchased My Memory Suite and will not look back. I hope Broderbund uses my money wisely 'cause they are dead to me."

451103,0.0,2018,Chip has more detail then my hds 12 had built in but much much less then any lake master or navionics chip that I had on my humminbirds in the past. I Would not buy it again and will probably still upgrade to a better chip soon
451111,1.0,2018,"Contains the essential features for basic professional recording from home, and with a user-friendly interface designed more for musicians than sound engineers."
451122,1.0,2018,good product

I LOVE the Kindle Cloud Reader, but some books are only available through an app so I downloaded the Kindle for Mac. I should have just bought the hard copy book. TERRIBLY disappointed."
451133,1.0,2018,It gets the job done as the app has it's purpose. Least it's faster and more responsive than the kindle itself.

When I add a book or books to the application it stops responding for a significant amount of time. Depending on if I am adding one book or multiple books, the time ranges from a couple minutes to 5 or more minutes. While it is adding the books it is totally unusable. That means it does not respond to any inputs until it us done adding the books. I will say that I have a large number of books in the application, probably more than the vast majority of users do. Other than the inability to read while it is updating, I have no other complaints about the application."

451144,1.0,2018,"I just used the MiniTool and it was great!  I wanted to merge C: and D: partitions on a 1GB HDD before installing and migrating everything to a new, smaller SSD.  I had some trouble when the C: refused to extend to cover the unallocated space created by deleting the D: partition, so I emailed the MiniTool people and they told me exactly what to do.  (Apparently, after I deleted the D: partition, my unallocated space was not contiguous with my C: partition, so it had to be moved before I could extend the C: partition to take in the unallocated space.)  They were prompt (next day response) and, based on a screen shot I sent, they told me exactly how to manage my partitions and unallocated space.  I am not that tech savvy -- at least when it comes to doing this kind of major surgery --- so I was very nervous that I was screwing things up.  It was very soothing to know that spot-on help was as near as an email away.  WONDERFUL PROGRAM!"
451145,1.0,2018,"It let me upgrade my too-small SSD to a larger SSD on a live computer. It wasn't fully automated, but it was close. And ultimately, it did the job, and when I swapped the C drive out for the new drive, it showed up and worked perfectly.

My ONLY complaint is that I'd like it to be more automatic. Have a mode that is ""upgrade to bigger SSD"" pick your disks, and go."

Also, it will not work in Windows 10 - I had to downgrade my operating system to Windows 7 in order to use it. (Windows 8 was an alternative, but after using it a couple of times at other computers, I decided it was not worth it.) Users need to have software which can work with more up-to-date interface, you know!

Stay faaaaar away from this junk. I bought this to record content for my YouTube channel, having decided to do PC content as well, and got this, plus the editing software, for $60 from their website.

I give this a 2 for one reason, webcams do not work. I have a C920 Logitech webcam that works with OBS just fine (another FREE recorder), but with Movavi, it often lags or the video will freeze altogether, and takes 5 minutes or so of recording to unfreeze.

On top of this, I've emailed customer support at least 4 times over 2 months and NEVER get a reply, just automated garbage suggesting I check their ""knowledge"" base (I did, and it doesn't help).

Stay away. They have an F if you look them up on the BBB. A red flag if I ever saw one."
451470,0.0,2018,"UPDATE: [see first part below] I have now registered after floundering around trying to enter the key received after purchasing at amazon several times and being told it was invalid. I finally found a place where it told me to start the program, use Tools/<something like> registration information to enter an 'amazon' key. When I did that and then checked my key within the program, it had been reassigned a new value so I THINK I'm ok now. IMHO the vendor needs to re-do the key entry parts of the program and website.

The program may be wonderful but with this flawed key entry, I'm giving it 3 stars. More later if it seems better or worse.

[Initial review} I've tried several times without success to get the software to recognize my purchase key. I sent an email for help which has not been answered after 2 days. Entry of barcode numbers seems to work fine. I'll update this if we get the registration fixed."

I know nowadays people have been streaming online and burning anything on a disc is OBSOLETE, but in my line of work, making videos for clients, people still want their circular fix.  Esp. blurays since many of the lowend and cheapo film fests use those to view in a theater.  Yes, BLURAYS look great in a movie theater!

The ability to crop and improve old pictures is very valuable. Some old slide are changing their color balance. I have been able to improve most picture/slides but not all. This is another tool that requires time to learn to use.

While I like the results after many months of learning, I wish there was a better way to learn how to use this program. I use You Tube most of the time. Adobe has good info on some topics but not all."

If only they allowed me to stop the software working in the background as I tell it manually who each face is, and then start it up again, it would work, but the software will not stop running and causing errors, even when paused.

451813,1.0,2018,"I am rating the Debut Video Capture Software for Mac, which I had purchased directly from the company. I never did locate it on Amazon even though I was searching for a package to support multiple USB-based microscopes that I did purchase on Amazon.  I am not now nor have I ever been compensated for a review, and I do not blindly rate an item either a 5 or a 1 with no ratings in between.

NCH would really like you to buy more of their software products, and they offer discounts if you add them now, or buy them within a certain period of time, like four hours. I am very wary of those offers since a good deal is hard to determine under the duress of a deadline.  So, I've only purchased this package so far.

What I have tried so far I like more than any of the dozen or so packages I have assessed.  My use case is support for multiple USB microscopes, such as the Pluggable 2MP and the Koolertron 5MP microscopes. This is a good test case because one identifies itself as a USB microscope and the later identifies itself as a Digital microscope.  Each product comes with included minimalist software to get you started, but I didn't want to use a different package for each scope, and the Koolertron software would not work with my other 'scopes. Be aware the software provided with each of these scopes is generally available on the Internet without charge, but they are sometimes coded to only work with the specific name given to the device (USB versus Digital).

First, I was impressed that the Free (Trial?) Version of Debut identified both of my USB-based microscopes immediately.  Where the Pluggable-provided Digital Viewer for Mac would not increase my snapshot resolution above 640x480, the Debut software was taking pictures immediately at 1600x1200 without changing any settings. It was the same with the Koolertron camera, identifying and using the highest resolution of the 5MP camera by default.

Second, the software is very stable.  I've seen other reviews for Digital Viewer and MicrControl Plus that suggest people are having stability problems on the Mac (I do not see that issue with those products) and Debut seems to work quite nicely and without any odd delays.

Third, I use this mostly to snapshots of microscope renderings and it's nice to have both single-shot and time-lapse readily available. As with many packages like this (even the free ones), it included features like on-screen titles and timestamps and the usual sets of image adjustments.

One concern is the software identifies my 2MP as 30fps at its highest resolution, so I need to test to see if it scales that back to the correct 7fps the camera supports.  I am also posting a Mac review under a Windows software package. That is because the link in the NCH Debut software brought me to this page, so perhaps that's why I never found the Mac version on Amazon - it might not be here."

451832,-1.0,2018,"When it works, it's great.  When it won't it's a nightmare.  No viable technical support, unless you want to write and email and wait for days for help.  Purchase Express Scribe Pro and the software launches, minimizes itself and you can't open the minimized window.  Uninstalled, reinstalled.  If you can use something else, do so.  I am a court reporter and a paralegal.  Wasted countless hours trying to get this software to play DS2 files, locks up, freezes.  Sorry I recommended this product to the lawyers I work for.  I see a lot of posts when I do a google search of others who experience the same issues and I never, ever, see any solutions.  See attached photo.  You can see I purchased the licensed software.  This is the window that loads onto the task bar, can't maximize it.  Did a system restore and it fixed the problem for a day, went right back to minimizing the window and non functioning.  Time is money.  This software has drained my resources!"
451833,1.0,2018,"As a Transcriptionist, I have used Express Scribe for years and it is awesome. The company is very responsive and helpful when needed and the software runs great and does everything I have needed to propel by business beyond six figures."

451835,1.0,2018,"I am very happy with this.  Easy to pair with the foot pedal I bought. Took a bit to learn, but as a court reporter, I was so happy with it that I bought it for my scopist."
451836,1.0,2018,This a great software and so easy to use. I used the set up wizard for adding the foot pedal and it worked immediately. No problem. I've had many problems with foot pedals in the past. The best purchase I ever made. I use it for work.
451842,1.0,2018,Easy to use and does a great job !!!!
451845,-1.0,2018,"This software is worthless, if I had to rate it would not even earn one star. I loaded it and would not do anything unless I purchased other software."

If you need accuracy for current US released CD's, walk away from this software, b/c it is non-returnable from Amazon.
I should have stayed with tried and true Nero Essentials.
I would recommend Amazon revise their policy to at allow an arbitration option so user's are not locked out with crummy software and no option for a refund if said software does simply not work.
I write code for a major software developer in the US and this software is likely open-sourced and modified, and they just need to disclose up front of the no refund policy. I'm more than peeved, and did not use profanity. I will after pressing the submit button."

I usually use the option that stops recording after no sound or video for X seconds because I didn't know how much was on each tape so I'd end up constantly checking on my computer while the tape ran waiting for it to end so I could swap a new one in.

If you're looking to digitize a bunch of home videos this software made it a breeze. Hardest part was sourcing the VHS player!"
451880,-1.0,2018,"I was not able to undelete files on my SD card, and that was the reason I purchased this product.  Orion needs to make this limitation clear in their product description.  I wish I could return it, but it's downloaded  software, so I blew my $20."

I use Windows 7 Ultimate, and SoundTap was easy to install, has never crashed, and works every time I need to record audio streaming on my computer. I've also found it easy to save my recordings to My Music to listen to again."
451893,1.0,2018,"I have been a SoundTap user for more than 7 years; I recently upgraded to the latest available version. It is simple software (for someone simple, like me!) I do a weekly podcast for which I need to record multiple lines (sometimes via Skype, sometimes via Google Hangouts) -- Soundtap always performs for me! I then use another NCH product, WavePad sound editor to mix my show. Again -- clean, simple, works great for someone like myself who doesn't need tons of bells and whistles, and who just wants my stuff to sound better -- and a touch more professional."
451894,-1.0,2018,"This does not work! When recording streaming audio, it ""skips"", thus playback is not smooth

I used Easy Share for a long time til that company went out of business and that product was no longer supported.  Easy Share was very easy. This product seems to be easier to deal with than many others that I have tried, although I am so not real computer literate and I don't fully understand all the functions and items in this program. I guess I will learn as I go. I'm still looking for tutorials for all of the functions, but it has done what I need it to do to this point. So if your not real literate in this stuff, try this one. It's working for me so far."
451914,-1.0,2018,Don't waste your money. Doesn't have the easy to use features like I am used to with Photoshop. I wish I could return it.

It only took about 5 minutes, was a breeze to get through the prompts and once I opened it from my desktop I realized it comes with so many more features than the old windows editor program anyways!!  I am so glad I found this!  Highly recommend :)"
451916,1.0,2018,Excellent software and pretty use to use.
451917,1.0,2018,"Light, fast, easy to use without having to read any guide and relatively efficient. Really worth the price"

451922,1.0,2018,"It is distinctly faster that Wondershare which started to make errors in loading and converting my files from M2T to Mp4

451924,1.0,2018,"Quick download, quick install, quick format conversion!"
451925,1.0,2018,"i have been using it or at least 15 year, it's great but the keep on trying to get paid , i have bought it in the past but they always got much better, and they always ask will you pay more, like faraway buzzing of biters at tropic siesta"
451927,1.0,2018,"Like all NCH programs Prism Video Converter is intuitive, easy to use and above all, does what it says it will do. My only problem was figuring out how to register it. That was solved when I went back and finished reading the email that contained the registration code."

I did think it came with alot more but once you buy FL Studio youll be glad you did comes with hidden perks all over. Dope set up. Good easy layout sounds are scrambled in packs. So was difficult to find what im looking for. You like music want to put ur soul into something as beauontic as music an know how to use studio product go for it. But if you don't have prior experience with working in the studio go for garage band or something for the mean time tell you want to upgrade an keep upgrading. Hints on a perk."

452076,1.0,2018,"This transcription software is great. I use an Infinity foot pedal with it, and it really speeds up my transcription. I also like the Prism video converter that is an add-on download (it was free) that converts video files so you can utilize ExpressScribe with a video playing in the same window."
452077,1.0,2018,"This is hands down the best transcription software there is.  I've used it for years, and I would not change to any other program.  I've had to use some specialty court programs for s a few things, and it's always a relief to get back to this one.  The enhancement possibilities make doing difficult audios much easier."

GREAT GREAT customer support. When it comes to tools I want blink twice. But a software I didn't view as a tool and battled about the decision. After using the free trial I purchased the pro version and I haven't looked back. It has been a great investment.

452193,-1.0,2018,"The program was so-so, but not the reason for the low rating. Hands down, the worst licensing system I have ever dealt with. After needing to reinstall the program after a hard drive crash, it would not let me because it was already licensed. After taking a week to respond, SummitSoft offered no help. Save your money and do not buy any products from this company, as you will regret it if you....the horrors.....need to reinstall."

452211,-1.0,2018,This software is a total mystery. Does not update ever and does not acknowledge registration after reinstallation on new Mac. Not sure what to think of it but I would not recommend spending your hard earned cash on it without a significant amount of independent research and some direct recommendations from users who have had more positive experiences.

452243,1.0,2018,"I have been looking for a typing program for my child, who is in second grade.  We tried some of the free programs online, but they were simplistic, boring and came with a lot of ads.  A friend recommended Mickey's Typing Adventure, and I looked it up.  The program is awesome, it's perfect for young children, using all the Disney characters to entertain them along the way.  It's an adventure, and the characters even talk to the kids, which further engages them.  There are many places to go, things to do, games, etc.  The core of the program is the typing training, with practices and tests along the way.  You can monitor your child's progress as well, with numerous reports that show their strengths and weaknesses.  The online version allows you to log in from anywhere, PC or Mac.  I highly recommend this for any child aged 5-8."
452265,1.0,2018,The lessons are well organized and it is easy to use.  You also get the written language and cultural information.  I am almost done with my first lesson and can properly greet someone now.
452266,1.0,2018,"I  took the free course in Rocket Russian and I must say that taking just the free lessons I have learned how to say some important Russian phrases and I am able to speak those phrases just like a native speaker. Just a few days ago I didn't know even the first word in Russian. However just after a few lessons I can say several words.  Rocket Russian has some great tutors that break each word down so that when you speak you can speak as if you have been speaking the language all of your life. I have noticed that the way they break down each word they are also training your ear to not just be able to speak the language but also hear what is being said. I purchased  the Rocket Russian course and I have been using it every day for at least an hour per day. My vocabulary and knowledge are expanding quite a bit, I have discovered that after just a couple of weeks I am able to spell many of the words I hear and with what I have learned I am beginning to be able to put together my own sentences. This software like any software has it's good qualities and not so good qualities but overall Rocket Russian is a great language course to own. I am very pleased with the education that I am gaining from using this software. It was definately money well spent."

452363,1.0,2018,"Worked well, but watch out for the city streets in Mytilini!
It took us all over town to get back to the hotel.  What should have been a 20 minute drive ended up about 40 minutes.
Incredibly beautiful territory, but with streets so narrow, I thought I was going to scrape my car on someone's fork at dinner.
It was late at night going back to the hotel, so that could have been the issue. (And - no, I wasn't tipping the Ouzo bottle before hand!)
It was plug and play.  I called Garmin about it before I bought and they even told me my GPS will work with this unit.
Great service from Garmin. And they even admitted that this price was about half of their price.
Item arrived just in time for the trip.
Didn't need in Italy, but I am confident it would have worked well there too."
452364,1.0,2018,"Much cheaper than renting a god from foreign car rentals. Maps were good, I got mine for Italy and it worked well. Allowed us to drive all over the country and find our hotels and places of interest very easily.
Would have five stars if it could help you avoid the zones where you get fined if not registered. Ran into three of those."
452365,1.0,2018,"I was hesitant to purchase this based on other reviews but thought I would try it and I am glad I did. It worked perfectly. We were on a driving tour of Italy and this chip found everything we needed. I was able to just put the name of a town in and it would find the town and then once there we could find specific destinations. Sometimes we wanted to take the quickest route and didn't mind paying tolls and sometimes we wanted scenic, it worked every time. It also helped us find landmarks in the area. Well worth the price. I highly recommend this product."

452367,1.0,2018,Loaned this to friends for their first trip to Italy abd it was a life saver.  We used an earlier version in Sicily and Used coordinates rather than addresses cery easily.
452368,-1.0,2018,"We bought this for a May, 2018 month-long trip to Tuscany and Umbria and was extremely disappointed. Occasionally, we were given correct driving instructions, but most of the time that was not the case. We were taken to entirely wrong destinations from the ones entered on the Nuvi we were using; told to turn on non-existent exits from expressways; and directed to turn into traffic on one-way streets. Oftentimes the directions and the map did not match up--we were directed to make turns that were not correspondingly shown on the map. When we drove from Tuscany to Umbria, and then back again, an error message popped up telling us the addresses in the destination province could not be found. On numerous occasions the route had to  be ""recalculated"" even though we were following and continued to follow the directions given. We finally gave up and followed local printed maps. The data on the card appears to be very, very old, as many roundabouts we took were not a part of the instructions nor on the Nuvi map. To offer this product for sale on Amazon reflects badly on the company. Until Garmin creates a product for Tuscan and Umbrian roads that actually works, Amazon should withdraw it from its offerings."

452477,1.0,2018,Learned a lot of information that is helping my novel to progress....
452478,1.0,2018,"My wife bought me this software for Christmas this year, and I have to admit, I turned out to like it much more than I expected. I've written two novels, plus a large number of short stories, all in MS Word, and pretty much was set on continuing with that process. But, given a chance to try something new, and having already decided to try outlining and writing novels with scenes as the basic building blocks instead of chapters, I felt I had to give it a try.

The hardest part so far was importing one of the two novels into the software and breaking it up into scenes. That was a chore, but in most cases people will be starting a fresh work in the software and this won't be a problem. I brought the chapters up into scenes and got everything inputted in a long session.

Having approached this with the intent to use scenes as a building block, the software is perfect for that purpose. I had several beta reader critiques to work with and began re-arranging scenes easily and quickly to match some of the common feedback I had received about pacing. The writing interface itself is fine, nothing fancy, but I don't really need all the bells and whistles of Word for this purpose (your mileage may vary if you're writing nonfiction technical documents with lots of graphics).

I tested exporting the document into Word format, and that functioned exactly as expected. I've explored some of the other tools of the software as well. I love the Story Board, which mimics the cork board/note card view you might be familiar with if you've seen ""behind the scenes"" features about the making of movies. I only wish I was able to shift around scenes in the Story Board view like I can in the standard view. There are tools to create characters and provide details, as well as events and settings. You can get a current wordcount of a chapter or the whole work, and it keeps track of how many words you've added during each session of work (note: it counts every word you type, even if you backspace and retype a word, so it'll pad your count a bit).

On the negative side, while you can use the + buttons to close a chapter (hide the scenes under the chapter heading), it doesn't save that choice when you close and re-open. You may be forced to scroll down on the left to find the place you want to work that day. Also, mouse scroll buttons don't work in the Story Board view, which is a bit of an oversight that can be easily remedied (as well as the aforementioned inability to move scenes around while viewing the Story Board).

I'm running this in an fairly newish system, a 3-year old desktop I pieced together myself, running Windows 8.1. Works great, no problems installing, and no crashes. Solid software, a good feature set, and at least one killer function (moving scenes around so easily) make this an easy piece of software for me to recommend, if you can afford the steep price.

All in all, I'm happy with the software and use it daily now. I'll try writing a whole novel from scratch with it when I've finished editing the current one, and we'll see if it continues to hold up and I can find ways of utilizing even more of it's features."
452479,1.0,2018,"Write it now is back from outer space with more organization to aid published authors and newbies in their journey before the first draft. The first one was a great introduction, but version two is a dream come true. I cannot find an alternative product on the market, fitting my needs like Write It Now.

In the old version, writers sacrificed ""chapters"" to organize the pre and post material. The updated version provides folders for glossary, foreword, and much much more. A few updates in the new version provides a surprising bonus. How cool it is to be timed with word count!

I plan on writing up a list of improvements that I think would be nice throughout the exploration of this new version. I have been a loyal customer in the past. I encouraged new authors to utilize the old version at every writing workshop I taught at libraries and comic Cons. I continue to sing the praise for this product. I recommend Write It Now 5 with a six star rating."

452554,1.0,2018,"I was just looking to buy a retail package of this software for my shop and noticed all the bad reviews.  I was curious so I read the comments.  I have used this software religiously for my customers data backup solution.  It's light, cheap and extremely versatile.  I believe the problem is that you need to read the instructions to set it up for you personal situation.  But unlike other software that comes with external hard drives, this software does not hide, encrypt or burry your backup files in some obscure location, Other programs do this so you have to use their software to retrieve your files which is why I don't use any other backup software.  In an event that you accidently erase something if you catch it soon enough it probably hasn't been deleted, Just moved to a hidden temp folder.  I can't comment to much on the support as I haven't had to deal with them much.  The software does what it says, It just isn't one click simple to set it up. Also, this is the only time I have left an amazon comment on any product.  I just felt that all the poor reviews were very undeserved."

452711,0.0,2018,"I wasn't willing to pay much for a program that played music using playlists. There was a program on the internet ages ago that did this for free and mostly likely is available in some form now, but I keep coming back to Amazon, because I have grown to trust them, perhaps too much, but I was happy to see that there was a program that didn't cost much, as in nothing and I bought it. Whatever deal they have with the makers I will leave it to them.

There seems to be some problems with its use. Not the greatest program I have seen. Adding songs to a playlist took longer than I like to say and the help option wasn't that helpful. If the makers are listening that might want to work on at least that part of their program. The part of the program that I had the most trouble with was adding songs to playlist that had already been created. I don't think it is possible to do this, because I tried and I don't believe I will try anymore. I ended up deleting the playlist and starting over, which I suppose is fine. I can work with it.

And I am playing the music right now and everything seems to be in order. Others might find this program as useful as me. But I only wanted to use a program that could group MP3 songs together in a playlists and hear them being played on the computer."

452812,-1.0,2018,"This was my second attempt to purchase this set.  Like the former order, unfortunately, the starter disk for this set failed to initialize, after several attempts.  Therefore, none of the DVD set could be viewed.  I returned it to the seller after notifying Amazon.  Note: I had a similar problem with the original set that I purchased new and installed a few years ago.  The PC on which it had worked failed and I needed to replace it.  After I tried to reinstall it on a replacement PC, I had a similar problem.  That is, the starter disk could not be installed.  That experience leads me to conclude that National Geographic designed the starter disk to work only one time.  I checked with National Geographic for assistance and learned they offered no help, nor do they offer the set any longer.  I'm still hoping to find a viewable set, but will purchase only one that the seller knows has never been installed.  I assume that the seller of this latest set was unaware that it could not be installed; i.e., I assume it was an honest mistake on this seller's part, and so too of the prior seller."

Then I decided I would use this now somewhat costly software to just convert the PDF and work it in another format. You have probably guessed by now, I will have to pay another fee to be able to use the conversion ability.  I am tired of trying to deal with the manner of how this program is peacemealed for multiple fees and will go back to basics by just retyping the complete document.

The main culprit is the Driver Power State Failure error, which has caused a crash at least once per day, and this is when my PC is literally just running idle with stock background processes. Tried all the fixes, and nothing has worked so far. There is also a blurriness issue on high-resolution monitors (mine is 2560x1440). The OS is crystal clear in some applications, and pretty blurry in others. None of the fixes worked, and I've given up. Really strange for the OS to be defective out of the box. My machine is new and I've never had any problems running Windows 7 on it. I miss Windows 7 in fact, and this is coming from a Linux user.

The price matches a retail version / none OEM version and the description does not state OEM. Under the key on the cardboard card says ""retail"". I give it one star as misleading information and at least not clear.

Someone suggested how to fix. I try this method b ut does not fix the issue. The correct 64 bit loads it is the activation issue.

Further - open command prompt and ran ""slmgr -dli"" command. Results shown below OEM. At this point I think everyone here should get a refund or a real Windows 10 retail key. Amazon time to step before more people buy this software. Or someone show everyone here how to fix this. Looks like I have to spend another $200 but it will be from MS directly."
453075,1.0,2018,"Microsoft, why aren't you distrobuting your OS this way, this was a heck of a lot much more efficient, and usefull."

453093,-1.0,2018,This is a DEMO only. Not the full software! Very disappointing as it was a gift for my son.
453095,-1.0,2018,"This programs sexist.  First, you have to start with a male character. There are no female options. You can add female characteristics, but your still using a male. Also, I can't put a dress on it. Shorts and pants are the only options. I regret buying it."
453096,-1.0,2018,All this program is a shell of a program. So the buyer shell out more money 99.89 to be exact to hopeful get the real program.  When you install the program it tells you this program is only good for 30 days if you want to continue to use this program you must pay 99.89 with in 30 days.
453097,-1.0,2018,Purchased this for my son and he doesn't like it. He wanted something more advanced.
453098,-1.0,2018,Definitely NOT what we thought it would be. I have a very unhappy animator. Will be looking elsewhere.

453103,-1.0,2018,This is a nightmare. I  even went and bought a new computer desk top.very up to date power and speed lots of RAM and 1TB . This program sucks. Everything I did to make it work even the best buy geek squad couldn't get this running. They said there's no reason why it should not working properly. Well after 2.5 weeks I returned it. This is bs. Fix the damn thing.
453104,-1.0,2018,Not user friendly...erase function is not easy to use with graphic drawing tablets...not sure what problem is.  Tablet or program? but eraser function is never available/functioning
453105,1.0,2018,A must for Animators. I've been using Anime studio for 10 years now. Extremely user friendly and quite powerful. Insane value for this edition with the last edition as anime studio before the re-branding as MOHO.
453106,1.0,2018,Niece loved This and was able to start using it right away.  Possibilities are infinate and worth the extra money to get the pro version.
453107,1.0,2018,"Love the program.  Update!  Initially frustrated serial number was not being recognized : (  Seller sent me note that when entering serial number can't use cap lock.

We chose Sibelius because that is what my daughter used in school, so once we get it downloaded, then I am optimistic that the program will work out just fine.

453366,1.0,2018,"Love, love, love this.  Great way to keep all of my recipes in one place and share them with the family.  Easy to access the info from my smart phone when in the grocery store to make sure I get all the ingredients needed to make a family favorite."

453387,-1.0,2018,"This is an utter POS.  I'm experiencing multiple complete-freeze-up/shut-the-machine-down-and-start-all-over episodes every day in Word.  I set autosave to once-a-minute and am manually saving as often as I remember to, or when I know I'm getting to a dangerous set of keystrokes (I do a lot of technical writing, so I subscript things like the ""2"" on CO2, and subscripts seem to be a problem).  Even at that, though, I'm still wasting a lot of time rebooting the machine to recover from what I've learned will be interminable hang-ups if I let it run.

I'm looking for a work-around to restore my productivity, but this is very disappointing.  MS seems to have cornered the market, so I need Word for compatibility with colleagues, but the problems with the program are maddening."

This Ashampoo PO 6 is just the tool i need for cropping, adjust lightness color saturation and sharpness. No need to use layers, alpha channels, and all kinds of masks and various selection tools like in photoshop. I believe if you just want to do simple editing and do not want to spend hours to learn using software like photoshop, you will find this Ashampoo PO 6 software is just right for you. There is no learning curve at all and the price is less than 10 dollars. And you can import big file from your camera and edit it in two minutes and it is done.

I never looked back and still love it in 2018."

Well it works perfect on windows 10 since that is what I have,  also the box and here on Amazon says it does.  These places seriously need to get people that understand the product and that speaks English. If anyone knows how I can get the product on my Wacom tablet please let me know.
Thank you"

453632,1.0,2018,I like it. Updates to current versions were free after purchase. Great editor. Will update and add photos later. Reviewing from phone at the moment. I would recommend this product. You own it and it provides free upgrades. Most edit sites you have to pay a monthly fee and upgrades are a fee as well.

I was totally happy with Quicken 2008, but decided to upgrade to 2016.  It was not until after I installed and converted my files that it told me this software will not accept previous data files as this is intended for new customers only and forces you to upgrade to another product that will cost you additional money.  This is aburb!!!!!!!!!!  I am unemployed and I have to watch every penny I have.  I had even talked with their customer support earlier because I was having problems installing and they said absolutely nothing about this.  This critical information should have been posted with their advertisement for ""New Users Only  - Will Not Upgrade From Previous Versions""!"

453897,-1.0,2018,"I have been using Quicken for > 20 years now and it's worse then it was when it had no graphics and was a simple two-color screen.  I have had to re-correct the same entries repeatedly, un-memorize transactions and vendors repeatedly, and manually reconcile entire accounts with the online site (which totally defeats the purpose of having Quick download transactions).  As painful as it will be I will not be buying the next upgrade they force on me and will migrate to MSFT Money or something else just to get away from the poor product they now provide.  It's a shame, I really liked this product when I first started using it in 1996.  I'd elaborate more but why bother?"
453898,1.0,2018,Product was as I expected and I would purchase again.

453901,-1.0,2018,The last two years with this piece of garbage software have been by far the worst in the 25 years I've been using Quicken.  So much so that I'm considering another platform entirely going forward.  90% of the time managing my finances has been putting things in by hand and dealing with software crashes.  I wish there was a competitor not owned by Intuit that I could migrate to it's been so awful.
453902,-1.0,2018,I found better online.  Backup feature or phone app never works.

453904,-1.0,2018,"I have used Quicken software for over 20 years, upgrading every 3-4 years to keep it working with latest security updates and other features. I originally upgraded from Quicken 2012 to Quicken 2016 about 2 years ago. This version has been NOTHING but a headache.

Persistent issues:
 - Update process hangs program about 1/2 the time
 - Program hangs periodically on various other functions
 - When online payments post, Quicken deletes the category (both category and account transfer impacted)
 - Quicken refused to recognize a check written on my checking account 9 months ago and still gives me out-of-balance upon reconciliation. I can't get rid of it and without adding an adjustment such that my register actually shows an incorrect balance.
 - Occasionally decides to add ""placeholder entries"" into investments resulting in incorrect share balances. These are hidden and a royal pain to remove.
 - Posting downloaded transactions sometimes adds the same transaction multiple times in investment accounts
 - For some accounts, downloads transactions that have previously been downloaded and posted (have to manually delete duplicates)
 - Defaults online payments to wrong payee for some transactions
 - Continually bugs you to upgrade your version on startup, even when you tell it not to show the message any more. Sometimes hangs on this message.

New issues:
 - I do NOT use cloud or mobile. WHY do I now have to periodically log in with an Intuit Id? I do not want it, and do not want to be forced to use it.

There's likely more I'm not remembering right now. Point is, after two years of support and updates, I can't believe fundamental issues such as the program hanging have not been addressed. Quicken 2016 is by far the WORST Quicken version I have ever used. It is buggy (still) and annoying.

Now, if I want to upgrade, they want me to purchase via a subscription model, forcing additional future payments upon me whether I want them or not. I am seriously considering finding another option after so many years of using this software. It is going downhill fast."
453915,1.0,2018,Great Product and super fast delivery.
453916,1.0,2018,"This is an update fro what I have used for years.  Do not want online, so this is the last available single computer version I can find."
453917,-1.0,2018,"The software is more cumbersome than Windows versions.  More importantly, I could not register my software with Quickbooks.  They had no knowledge/record of the Serial Number or the Validation Code.  I can't get any help or upgrades.
One can only make the assumption that the software I received was a counterfeit version."
453918,0.0,2018,Does a good job with invoicing but I can't do the credit card thing with this program.  Disappointing.
453919,-1.0,2018,"Quickbooks does not work with MAC. Do not believe QB tech support when they tell you it does or when they tell you to upgrade to the cloud version. I have used QB 2014 and upgraded (or downgraded ) to QB2016 and have encountered many glitches.  The latest issue is that I can't convert my file to windows (for an accountant review). I sent the file to quickbooks data services as requested and it's been 12 days later and still no 'fixed' file. Very disappointed with technical support and that fact that you, Intuit,  sell a defective product."
453920,-1.0,2018,"I hadn't opened the package until now and there was nothing it. Now I am out $180+ dollars for nothing. I even tore it apart hoping there would be some kind of information. No code, no instructions, no CD, nothing, just an empty box."
453921,0.0,2018,"Do I like quickbooks as a software? Yes. What I do not like is the forced upgrade and problems with mac to windows conversion on QBO files and the fact that I had 2-year-old software that didn't work after a mac OS update. I was forced to buy a new version. They promised they were 'working on an update' to fix the issue with Quickbooks 2014 for mac. They said they would give me a discount on the current version of the software for the problem and after doing some research it wasn't really a discount at all! I was just sold new software. DON'T EVER upgrade your MAC OS version until you verify that it is compatible with your version of QuickBooks or the next time you open it - it may not work. I wasn't planning on buying a newer version of Quickbooks until 2018 and had to upgrade early.

Something else that bothers me about this version is that it limits how many characters show on downloaded transaction names. It makes life much harder sometimes when it doesn't import ALL of the text of a named downloaded item transaction."
453945,1.0,2018,It was a good purchase I've owned older versions for PC but recent purchased a Mac so needed on for Mac. I am just getting use to this version but having no issues.
453957,1.0,2018,What we expected.  Quicken is not a perfect product but it is what we use.
453959,-1.0,2018,"After only two years, there is no real support for the product. Quicken has gone downhill. I am unable to download from my financial institutions. The companies say that quicken is not responding to their requests for help. Quicken has not responded to my requests for assistance. In fact, they deny there is a problem. After reading reviews, upgrading would not fix the issue. In addition, it continuously downloads duplicate transactions from one financial institution. It is constantly asking me for my password. I have updated and installed all patches to no avail."

453987,1.0,2018,As advertised
453988,-1.0,2018,"This software is a joke!  Do NOT purchase this crap thinking you can keep track of your finances.  All you do is spend all your time trying to make it work correctly. It drops your online bank connection constantly and will not re connect, leaving you unable to update and download everyday transactions.  It is such a pile of S***!! DO NOT bother."
453989,-1.0,2018,Extremely hard to use. It is not user friendly at all. Almost impossible to check your bank account automatically. We quit using it.

454001,0.0,2018,"Love the price and the transaction from Amazon as always, I'm just not happy with the quickbooks setup to where they make you use a lot of passwords and just the fact that they control how you use qucikbooks and can shut you down if you don't do this or that, such as loadinf their updates."
454036,1.0,2018,In process of using but has already been of help on a few things. Glad I got it because it is easy and user friendly and I will be using it alot.

454116,-1.0,2018,"Particle Shop uses some pretty slick advertising to market the plug-in.  In truth, it looks awesome.  IRL, it is far less useful and difficult to use.  If you are looking for that one ""special effect""  You will likely have to buy additional effects/texture packages.  But DO NOT DESPAIR!  Corel has got you covered, as they bombard you several times daily with online and offline popup ads making sure that you know that you can purchase that special effect you might or might not have wanted.  I do not recall signing up for this when I downloaded the software from the Corel site."
454117,-1.0,2018,There are no clear instructions indicating where this product is stored and how one can easily bring it up for use. I can find it in downloads but that's is..... why isn't it built right into Photo Shop with an easy access icon? The constant pop=ups are annoying especially for a product  most people will impossible or extremely hard to find and/or use.
454135,1.0,2018,QB is QB  is QB  price was great  Thank you
454136,0.0,2018,"I've been using QuickBooks Pro desktop version for years and for the most part it met my needs and thankfully Amazon had the best price for the digital download. Downloading, installation and setup of the program was not hard or time consuming at all. The Online Essentials came with the program and I thought since I am mostly in the field and mobile, it would be faster and more efficient for me to process my transactions in real time online. That's where the difficulty came - transferring all of my client data, chart of accounts, existing transaction data and etc. to the software as a service platform. Once I got it uploaded, I needed to create an invoice from an estimate I had created in the online program and that is when everything online came to a screeching halt!

At that time, the Intuit advertised the Online Essentials version of the program as having the ability to create estimates and convert those estimates to invoices and invoice the customer all in real time. But when I tried to do that, the Online Essentials program would not allow me to do that. I called Intuit's customer service and they told me that I would have to purchase the next tier up in order to do that. The next tier had extra things that I could never use for my business. They wanted an exorbitant price that cost a mint for that next tier up and that is where I drew the line. I closed my Online ""Essentials"" program and looked for an online software as a service program that was as good, if not better than QuickBooks. I found  an excellent service that still meets my need in 2018.

The other thing that disturbed me about the two programs was that they could not synchronize. So I gave up using QuickBooks Pro 2016 edition altogether except when I need to print out checks, because I still have a pretty good stock of the QuickBooks compatible check stock left.

QuickBooks 2016 version was good in its time, but the 21st century way of real time accounting is the way to go for me. My new service is just right and charged me in 2017 only two Ben Franklins."
454137,1.0,2018,I wanted it for years and finally bought it. This software is an icon in its field and delivers any and every accounting need.
454138,1.0,2018,"Quickbooks is my favorite accounting program. For me, it's intuitive and easy to use, and easy to customize to work the way I think. Of course, I've used this program since the dawn of time, and I'm a bookkeeper. I've noticed that my friends who don't know how to keep books really struggle with it, so I think the ease of use thing has to do with what you  bring to the table."

454200,1.0,2018,Easy to install
454202,1.0,2018,"Honestly overpriced, i was shocked to see that it no longer includes payroll. You now have to call quickbooks to order payroll separately, it will have a separate log in etc... to much work for a supposedly all in one program.  Will no longer use quickbooks"
454210,-1.0,2018,"If you are an individual who thinks that the complex should be made easy, then don't waste any money on this software. This is so far removed from user friendly, it might as well been developed by aliens. Even making a simple invite is a task. They use terminology that I don't think most of us would even understand. Navigating all the options is a maze of complexity and confusion. This is not for the average human, who every once and a while wants to make just a simple birthday invite. Sure, there are 20 minute YouTube videos that can show you this. But seriously, do I need to watch a 20 minute video to do a simple invite."
454220,1.0,2018,Good
454241,-1.0,2018,"You should only buy this software if you like solving mysteries, or if you enjoy spending an hour clicking on various tabs and buttons to see what happens. This software is unbelievably hard to use. It's not at all intuitive or friendly. As a user I was never sure at any moment if I was performing the correct steps to initiate a Back-up or a Restore.

The 'HELP"" files are the most confusing, ambiguous, incomplete, and sometimes flat-out incorrect 'Help' files I've seen in the last 20 years. The NTI company had someone write the 'Help' files but no one checked to see if the 'Help' files were correct, or even understandable. Once during an attempted Restore operation, the 'Help' file said ""Click on the 'OPTIONS' button."" There was *NO* 'OPTIONS' button!! There are all manner of buttons, tabs, and boxes in various windows upon which you can click, but the 'Help' file gives you no information on what will happen if you click on them.

After I defined a Restore operation the software asked me when I wanted my 'Restore' to happen, ""Now"" or ""Later."" When I clicked the ""Now"" button, nothing happened! No Restore took place! I am not joking."
454245,-1.0,2018,"The interface is difficult to use, and one is never sure exactly what is happening.  I wish NTI would go back to the interface they had with Backup Now 3.  That was an elegant, easy to use interface."
454246,-1.0,2018,"So..Wanted a flexible Windows 10 backup tool. Should have done more research. Have multiple profiles on our home PC. Dell w/3.6G I7, 16GB memory and SATA-SSD. Windows backup worked OK, but wanted more granularity. Software installed with an issue. It was an older version requiring update from the vendor site. Update completed, now called Backup Now Pro. Started backups. After 24 hours, still running. Decided to read vendor FAQ's. Surprise surprise.. talks about running with Pentium cpu's. Perhaps a bit dated.. ya think! Still cannot get their continuous backup to function. I consider this purchase a cheap lesson."

Their is no disclaimer for this on the packaging and it is a very deceptive marketing practice. Buyer beware.  Personally, after several conversations with Acronis directly, I will no longer use the product, nor use any Acronis suites in the future out of principle.  The combination of the deceptive marketing, unusability of inherent localized tools of the suite, and the companies polite but dismissive stance to not appreciate how the product has failed a consumer like myself, or credit me in any way to attempt to keep me as a customer  is disappointing."

He starts yelling at me, why did you call then. You should not call if I cant fix for you. And on & on. It was really ugly, and I hung up.

I tried to get tech support involved with nothing and then asked for a refund and they have given me nothing but a run around to get information. I'm a widowed mom who has 3 kids to take care of and felt like I deserved to treat myself.

454567,1.0,2018,"I've been using Serif PhotoPlus software since it came out on floppy disk. Lol
I've also been using Photoshop nearly as long and frankly, for the money, Serif PhotoPlus X8 is my favorite photo editing software,hands down.  It has an interface that's a mixture of MS Office and the older versions of Photoshop, which is to say, it's a familiar and intuitive interface.  It's compatible with all of the same plug-ns that Photoshop handles and has easily accomplished everything I've ever needed a photo editing program to do.
From indie game development, web design, photo editing or software GUI's, I've never had to look elsewhere for other software with regard to the raster graphic aspect of design.
I'm sad to see that this is the last release from the PhotoPlus line.  It's now been replaced with Serif Affinity.  Affinity is a grab at trying to be more like Adobe Photoshop.  Apparently Serif felt the PhotoPlus interface was too antiquated and needed a more modern look.  All they've managed to do is alienate a loyal following of user's make a depressing looking, dark grey interface that is frustratingly un-intuitive.  After spending a week with a trial of Affinity, I happily uninstalled it.  It's not so much that I can't learn to navigate new software.  I have to with many other varieties of software.  Affinity is just plain bad. And bad software just gets in the way of everything.

I love PhotoPlus X8.  It's totally inexpensive and does everything you need it to do."

454802,1.0,2018,Very helpful. It has helped me a great deal.
454803,-1.0,2018,"I should start by saying that I do already have some knowledge of Office products.  However, this product teaches only the basics.  I was disappointed in the fact that if you know how to open a document, type, print, and save, you have pretty much learned everything the ""professor"" has to teach. The program also runs really slow and the graphics are similar to the original Oregon Trail I used to play on the original Apple back in the 90's.  If you are looking to develop a true understanding of Microsoft Office, I would look elsewhere."
454804,-1.0,2018,please issue credit as product will not in stall. I'm using Amazon installer and it fail from the get go.
454806,-1.0,2018,I downloaded it and all that was there were a bunch of files that when opened were gibberish or just pictures! I have purchased downloadable stuff before and this has been the worst experience I have had to date.
454809,-1.0,2018,I was happy with the program for 18 months. Then I was locked out and unable to retrieve my data.  I was told to renter the key when I did I was told the program had been used too many times

454811,1.0,2018,The perfect PIM for users who want robust information management without the hassles of Microsoft Outlookas long as you don't mind its Window 3.1-looking design.
454812,1.0,2018,I lost an older version in a computer update at work.  This new version is better.  Perfect for my needs
454813,1.0,2018,"I've been using AnyTime for over 13 years now.  I bought the program once and it's still good unlike many products where the company stops supporting it.  I've never needed instructions because the program is so easy to use!!  I have all my bills on repeat, entered in the To-Do List so I know when they are due.  I have everyone's birthday in my address book so I never miss a birthday. If I know anniversary dates, I put those in as well.  It's my secret weapon to ""remembering"" how long friends and family have been married. :)  I'll even make notes in my planner for when and where I purchased appliances, TV's, phones, etc and how much I paid or when the warranty is up.  I use my search feature weekly to find simple stuff like this.  I have everyone's mailing address in the address book so I'm able to sort by groups to print out pre-marked addresses for Christmas labels.  I even have a group just for neighbors.  There are so many useful features!! I have contacted technical support by email a few times over the years and have always got my problem handled in a timely manner.  What prompted me to leave a review today, after all these years, was because I did an update on my BIOS in my computer and AnyTime stopped working.  My activation key was not accepted.  I contacted Anytime by email (on a Sunday) and they replied within the hour.  They gave me a new code and it was fixed within that same hour!  That is just unheard of these days.  I'm glad I found this program and still love it after all these years!!"
454815,1.0,2018,"Great for keeping Track of Appointments &Birthdays, etc. This is an upgrade I ordered. (Make sure that you Back it up."
454816,-1.0,2018,"Horrible! I had the old version and it suddenly stopped working. When I wanted to print it tells me it stopped working...  so I decided to buy the new version and after inputting all my dates for the year it does the same. Very frustrating.

Don't waste your money. Still not working and no help!!  Crap."
454817,-1.0,2018,"It's a waste! A poor interface from like 20 years ago... now can't even open it, won't stay up for more than a second! a totally unusable piece of crap!"

454824,1.0,2018,"This has been perfect for me to learn. Although the initial setup confused me and it took a couple of tries, I finally understood how to install it. The price was great, too."
454828,-1.0,2018,"Using it since a year or 2.
Started out OK, but lately it is becoming unusable. Especially issues with emails that were never sent and go into drafts without any obvious notification they never left. Missed out on serious business opportunities because of it.
Selecting addressees to compose a new mail is very counter intuitive.
Does not seem to play nice with Outlook accounts. Just had to spend half an hour to send one email, really fighting the program every step of the way... Don't buy, even outlook is better, as rubbish as it is..."
454829,-1.0,2018,"The ONLY pros is it is $9 and syncs with Google Contacts.

CONS:
Cannot add words to your Dictionary
Cannot add a cc when replying to an email
Cannot delete any ccs when replying to an email
cannot add a cc when replying to an email
Window does not open fully thus you have to scroll down to hit Send
Cannot sort by column (date, recipient, subject, size, etc)
Cannot delete a message while reading the message.  You have to close out, then hit delete
HORRENDOUS Customer Support!!!  I paid for Pro and when I asked for something, they gave me incorrect information only to later acknowledge ""that feature is not yet available"".  They refuse to accept phone calls.  They will not reply to your replies.  You have to start a whole new ticket even when the ticket is still Open."
454830,1.0,2018,Love it. Love that all emails can be seen at once. Very easzy to use and set up. Definately worth it.

454861,-1.0,2018,Mnot for newer computer programs
454874,-1.0,2018,"Expensive! Even though you pay for the access, the instructor still has the ability to control the features you use.  For example, the course I took included weekly quizzes through Cengage.  The instructor disabled the feature that allowed us to see our responses after taking the quiz, allowing us only to see the questions as we took them and our score after submitting.  This is such a terrible design.  If I pay for the course, the book, AND online access, I expect to get FULL access.  I couldn't even study for the midterm or final using the quizzes because while I knew my score, I did not know which questions I got wrong.
Also, for the list price, you get 6 months of access which is incredibly useless in my opinion.  I paid much less for the textbook and I get to keep that forever."
454878,0.0,2018,very good program but requires a lot of memory in the computer
454888,1.0,2018,"It is clear the reviews on this product vary greatly, from much love to intense hatred. Having used this product now for several years, I must say that I have been very pleased with the performance and results, ESPECIALLY after upgrading some components on my desktop. In particular, I bought a new dedicated graphics card and increased my system RAM to 16gb. I can't tell you difference these upgrades made. I ""used"" to have random crashes, and the program would frequently freeze, but now these issues are rare. In fact, PowerDirector is running smoother than ever. My system build is as follows: Windows 10, i5 4690 processor, 16 gb RAM, 2gb GPU, SSD main drive, SSD secondary drive, and a third platter drive for storage. I have produced several promotional videos for Camp Living Waters in Danforth, Maine, along with a number of other productions. You can check out the results via Youtube. Just type in peterpulpitpounder, and that should bring up the videos. For the money, I think PowerDirector is a very good value."

Knowing someone who is familiar in using it is a plus."
454909,-1.0,2018,I purchased this product back on August 10 and still today can't get the item to properly activate!  I have worked with Microsoft to figure it out and it still says that it is not an authentic item.  I have downloaded everything as the program stated and Microsoft has remotely attempted to log into the computer to figure out the problem but nobody has been able to complete the activation.  Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

454914,-1.0,2018,The MS Word portion of the product won't load or update correctly and it won't update.  I'd like to get my full refund and get something with the Outlook product or the software that emulates the MS suite
454915,-1.0,2018,"I have now spent $100 on a technician to try to correct a problem in the system.  It will not allow you to ""authorize"" the system.  It is clear from on-line reports that this has been a consistent issue, which Microsoft is aware of but has not resolved.  AMAZON can you help me?  I am a professional educator and need the system.  Microsoft seems to offer no assistance.  HELP!"
454916,-1.0,2018,I am having the same problem as all the others. Why oh why did I not read the reviews before purchasing? Unable to authenticate. So mad at myself and amazon right now.
454917,1.0,2018,Awesome to find a good buy on the product by Microsoft.
454918,1.0,2018,"Had some trouble installing this program - directions are not very clear.  Called for help and they were able to assist me.  Elements is a cut down version of Photoshop, and lacks many of the important features such as curves, channels, pen and many of the filters.  Does let you use RAW camera editing, but not as fully as PS.  Also annoying (and greedy) that you cannot upgrade your version like an app, but must purchase a new version or subscription to get updates. Updates used to be free.  Still the best picture editing program around though."
454938,1.0,2018,Works just right!
454939,1.0,2018,Bought this for my daughter and she still uses it and it is perfect for her

454942,-1.0,2018,"I purchased this, but when I tried downloading and activating this software, it tells me the product key is already used?!
What the hell, Amazon?  Is Amazon not providing genuine unique product keys, or is this some convoluted ""product key"" generator that they figure out with Microsoft later??
It's a shame it is non-refundable.  What a waste of money.
Save yourself the trouble and make sure to purchase the hard copy Product key (Product Key that comes in a small box).  MUCH better results."
454943,1.0,2018,"Several things about WORD still drive me nuts. The default is adding a space between paragraphs, and you can not change the default. Got to change it every ^&**#!! time. Etc."
454944,-1.0,2018,"I just buy this product today on 8/17/2018.  I installed it on my laptop.  When I wanted to activate it by internet. It is said that the activation key for this product is not valid.  Moreover, this product cannot be activated by telephone."
454945,1.0,2018,Great opportunity and perfect experience.
454946,-1.0,2018,"It took me two hours of sheer frustration to download the software key.  I am by nature and training a very patient person, but at one point I had to walk away from my new MacBook Air and sit in our garden for 30 minutes to regain my composure and normal thought processes.  As others have reported, I did the download and got a ""we don't recognize this 25 digit key"".  I tried various microsoft ""help"" functions and finally stumbled on a place to request a phone call with a real live person.  The wait time was 301 minutes.  I continued to hunt for help and finally, serendipitously, somehow landed on a chat site with a guy who connected me with a tech who ghosted my laptop and installed the software for me.

I really resisted buying the software and was turned off by the prospect of paying an ongoing subscription fee.  I tried the Mac's Figures and Pages software for a week and ultimately concluded my 20+ year histories of Word & Excel, and my wife's continuing use of them, posed compatibility issues which made me bite the bullet and make the one-time purchase.  What a pain."
454947,1.0,2018,"So before I bought this product, I had, of course, searched for the same product within Amazon for a less expensive purchase.  It seems that somehow this product is being sold at a lesser price, but reading reviews it appears that buyers were unable to access the software because it lacked a license or key.

Anyways, this review is just to let you a potential buyer know that I had no problem downloading the software and no problem activating it.  Fairly quick download with broadband and all done.

I gave it the rating I did, because, well its word and excel, (I do not use powerpoint) so no surprises when I started using the programs.  Expectations met!"
454948,1.0,2018,Easy to download. Love it!
454983,1.0,2018,Downloaded and had running on my PC in 10 minutes.  I am new to MS Project but opened the commercial construction template and am entering data now.
454984,-1.0,2018,I can't download the software
454992,0.0,2018,I have been unable to download it because the license code only works in the U.S. I sure would like to use it since it costs a lot of money.
454993,1.0,2018,I like the publisher feature best - does a lot more with dressing up your illustrations and photos. I also find that Word 2016 more forgiving with uploading and maintaining the dpi in a photo.
454995,1.0,2018,Nice
454999,1.0,2018,Worked great as a download
455001,1.0,2018,Love it ...
455003,-1.0,2018,"Do NOT order this from Amazon.  It says professional, but the download is for standard.  If I wanted standard, I could have saved $200 or more.  Amazon has also need nonresponsive on my complaint so far."
455008,1.0,2018,"Well, it's Office 2016 for Mac.  So already you know that you are getting a version of Office for your Mac that is outdated.  But I didn't have any issues installing it or running it on my Mac and I keep my Mac running the latest OS.  I will say that if I had it to do over again I would rather go with Office 365.  I just think you getting a more updated version that way.  Of course, the Windows version of Office will always have more than the Mac version.  It's Microsoft versus Apple.  It's a shame but it works that way."
455009,-1.0,2018,Amazon not giving MS the product ID. Had to spend an hour with microsoft hell to untangle this mess. Just go to MS website to purchase. Awful.
455010,-1.0,2018,purchased and downloaded but cannot install on computer. My I.T. provider has tried 3 different times.  item is non-returnable yet i cannot use it.
455011,-1.0,2018,Ok - you can send and receive google emails (gmail and g suites) but you CAN NOT import view and sync contacts and calendar items. The free Outlook app for iphone lets you access all those functions and so does the subscription Office product. but not this one. It's the only reason I bought it was to update word / excel with newer versions and to have all my emails in one client. #fail
455012,1.0,2018,Works great
455013,-1.0,2018,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!

The activation code DOES NOT WORK!!!! RIP OFF!!!!  Tried by phone too... read others post TOO LATE... and cannot activate!"
455014,-1.0,2018,"Update 2: I had another tech support session with Microsoft, this time with a level 2 technician. After 45 minutes watching the tech try everything I already tried, he told me that I had a known issue. There is no timeline for a fix. He was very sorry, but for now, I'll have to erase and reinstall my license every 15 days so I can continue using Office. This time, the tech gave me a different download with a new installation ID. Same problem. He said the research team is trying to fix this bug. Why sell this product if it's known not to work? I've nearly 2 hours with Microsoft tech support and at least 4 hours troubleshooting on my own. This is such a waste of money and time. DO NOT BUY! Unfortunately, I have to use this for work, so I'm stuck reinstalling the license every 15 days and dealing with annoying pop ups that remind me to activate the product.

Update 1: I've now spent over an hour on tech support with Microsoft, and my issue isn't resolved (product won't activate). I now have to have a support call with a level 2 Microsoft person, and the earliest appointment is tomorrow. Instead of giving me another download so that I can try a different activation code, they insist on the support. What should be a simple download/install on a new computer has turned into a time sink.

Original: The software will not activate. When I try to activate it by telephone because it would not activate via my Microsoft user account, I get a message that this is not a genuine Microsoft product. I have no idea what to do now, and I'm out $200+. I've tried doing a complete uninstall/reinstall twice, and I've followed every white paper. DO NOT BUY! I tried to install this on a brand new MacBook, so there should not have been any issues."
455015,-1.0,2018,I was having great difficulty trying to get through establishing this account with microsoft. I was not able to talk to someone I could understand and feel comfortable with in helping me. Recording sends me to their website. I had to request a refund. Why can't you just buy a piece of software and install it. Microsoft has made what should be something simple into something difficult.
455016,-1.0,2018,"Running Word 2016 for Mac for a few minutes was consistently correlated with my 2008 Mac Pro freeze, and requiring a reboot. Version 16.13.1 of Word 2016 does the same thing on my 2013 Mac Pro running the High Sierra OS. PowerPoint 2016 and Excel have both been stable. I do not know what is causing the instability, and it happens when Word is the only application open. My antivirus has been disabled, and therefore Word 2016 for mac is unusable. Maybe Apple and Microsoft can identify the erroneous code."
455017,-1.0,2018,"If there was a ""0"" ranking, that's what this software would get.  If you need to use Microsoft Office, DO NOT RUN it on a Mac, use a Windows 10 platform.  I use both between businesses, Windows Office 2016 works perfectly day in/day out, MS Office 2016 on a Mac is a disaster (High Sierra). Be prepared for the spinning wheel crash at the worst of times, and frequently saving files and/or relying on a recovery version is not dependable at all. I have lost hours of work in Excel and I save frequently because it is unreliable.  Reading numerous threads on the subject, I could spend hours trying this and that, but I'm not a programmer and I don't have the interest or time to try every little experiment on MS and Apple support threads.  Office 2016 for a Mac is crap and the people who write and support it should be fired, now!  If you read this, you have been warned!"
455028,-1.0,2018,"They offer a free trial, but the ""free trial"" didn't work unless I purchased the upgrade. I suspect a ripoff."

455030,-1.0,2018,"Downloaded the free version - very limited. However, after reading these reviews, I would never pay $59.00 for this junk. Instead, I found a free one that works incredibly well. It's called: ""Any Video Converter"" Free download and totally free usage - no strings attached."

455242,-1.0,2018,Bought this direct yesterday.  Tried to convert DVD for iPad and message said it was ILLEGAL TO DO IN THIS COUNTRY.  Links to HELP and Phone numbers are bogus.  Guessing recent reviews are from company scammers.  Im out $70.  Dont buy this protect.
455243,1.0,2018,Does everything I wanted it to do. I can copy my dvd's onto my computer now. It's a system I have to work with as far as there always is a need to tweak things.
455244,1.0,2018,"I was reluctant to purchase this software based on the ratings/reviews I have seen over the years. I finally got to the point that I am desperate to start putting some of my disc collections on hard drives to make them easier to access. I am using this software to make backup copies for my own personal use, as it is intended to be used. I was pleasantly surprised to find the software works about as great as I had hoped it would. In order to copy/convert copyrighted discs, you will need to agree to a legal notice and download additional files. The download is simple and automatically updates the software. I have used this software on both Windows 7 and Windows 10 computers without any issues so far. As with most software, there is a learning curve, so expect it to take a little while to learn how to use it. This software is just for copying/converting discs, it does not provide disc/file player capabilities. Personally I use PowerDVD by Cyberlink as my media player, but there are other options out there, some being free to use.

I am only using this to rip discs to hard drives, not to make physical copies of discs, so my review is limited to that function. I have been using it to convert music CD's, audio book CD's, DVD's and Blu-ray discs. I have only had a problem with a few music CD's that have had their own player software embedded on the discs. There is a pop-up progress window that appears once you start to rip, ignore the ""Time Remaning"" estimate, it's never accurate. Indicating hours of time remaining and only taking minutes to finish. The number of individual tracks affects the length of time to rip as well. For example, one of the slowest music CD's that I have ripped was a music soundtrack with 30 individual tracks but all of the tracks were 2 minutes or less, it took about 40 minutes to rip as a 32 bit wav file. While a standard music CD with about 10 tracks will take less than 10 minutes. Music CD's are ripped as individual tracks and with the names of the songs. DVD's take a little longer and Blu-rays as well. For DVD's and Blu-ray movies and TV series, I am ripping only the movie/tv episodes and not the full disc with menus. This is considerably faster and uses much less space on my hard drives.

I can't comment on customer support as I haven't had a need to contact them.

For my specific needs, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this software to others.

*** Update ... I have encountered some MKV discs which has required an additional paid plugin. Annoying and a little disappointing, but it does not change my review. I am still enjoying the software and still learning more about using it."

455779,-1.0,2018,"Majority of the instruments are flat sounding, the percussion that is supposed to be present within the program never actually sounds as it should except when inputting it, and if you are trying to place chords within it that differ in rhythm it is horrendous. I really wish i did more studying into this software before purchasing it. For the price you are spending on it the crappy quality should definitely be expected. I only thought it was so cheap due to it being a not so highly recognized composition software, now I know it is because most of the instruments and the overall look of the printed sheets are garbage. What makes things worse is that when and if you have issues with the software their customer service is just as bad. There is no phone number to call directly to help, no direct email to get in touch with anybody, and no form of instant messaging. You have to submit for help in this very generic emailing platform and their response times are either very vague or extremely lagged. Definitely saving up to get me something way better."
455780,1.0,2018,"I trusted the good reviews about this product and I purchased it. It is indeed a very user-friendly software which allows the composer the freedom to change the notations at will and to have an idea how the final rendition will sound. The possibilities so far appear endless.
The only problem, as reported by many users, is the registration which all buyers wish to complete right after installing any application. It was the case which brought me some frustration. I did not panic because there is a 30-day trial after installation. If only the distributors could solve this problem, this program would beat the competition.
By the way, I am still waiting for my registration code."
455781,-1.0,2018,"Absolutely the worst product support I have come across for any software purchased to date!

I was also able to get through via phone and was promised a follow up via email for the activation code. Again, no follow up. While the software seems to be nice (all that can be used is a 30-day temporary trial version that is downloaded from the disc), spare yourself the aggravation and the waste of money!! I have returned the product."
455783,1.0,2018,"This program is not fully functional without first registering the product. I would give the product itself a higher rating if not for the difficulty activating it. To save future purchasers the trial & error trouble I experienced, here are the REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download/Install the program
2. Press ""Get Key"" link in the Registration window (access window under ""Registration"" in Help menu).
3. Select your product from the drop-down menu on the activation screen.
4. Type your ""Activation Code"" which is the SERIAL NUMBER provided on the sticker on your CD envelope. INCLUDE DASHES in the number.
5. Provide your name and email address in the appropriate fields.
6. Click ""Submit"" and an email will be sent to you with your ""Registration Key.""
7. In the Registration window of your program (step 2) type your name and the Registration Key you received via email into the appropriate fields.
8. Click ""Apply Key"" button.
9. Close and restart your MagicScore program.
10. Your product should now be registered and licensed to you. You can verify this by clicking ""About..."" in the Help menu.

Hope this helps! I have used the MagicScore Maestro program to write a 6 page composition and so far I'm happy with it."

455931,-1.0,2018,"To be clear, this review is for a product I got from a third-party seller (Angie Powell). I'm a student and I bought what I thought was a legit copy for a class this semester. The serial number was bogus and I couldn't register it. The disc didn't even look right. I checked the printed serial number several times and still got the same result. If I could give zero stars, I would.

Edited to add: the seller (Angie Powell) contacted me with two more bogus codes and asked me to remove my negative feedback. Upon closer examination of the disc I was sent, I am 100% certain that this is pirated software because no legit place would have allowed this to get by QA. The fine print has two glaring imperfections. Microsoft is not capitalized and ""TuroCAD"" is listed as a registered trademark of IMSI. I've added pictures of these two tells. Plus, the print itself is low-quality and not what you'd expect from a large and reputable company."

456165,-1.0,2018,"I have always used Turbo Tax downloads for my taxes but the program that I downloaded (yes, I am late on my 2015 taxes...), simply wouldn't run. I reloaded it several times but to avail.

456227,0.0,2018,"Turbo Tax has become almost essential - taxes are extremely difficult to do accurately and Turbo Tax used to be really good at getting one through. I've used it for more than a decade. However, it has now added features that can prevent online filing the return you should file.  This problem comes at the final stage where it has checked for errors and you are ready to electronically file and have paid Turbo tax a supplement to also file the state tax online. Before sending, the program subjects the return to one last check and finds what it thinks is an new error, and then makes me  correct the supposed  error before submitting.  In my case, it decided I needed to claim an adopted child and refused to allow me to file until I had supplied the child's name. The only trouble was I had no such child, nor had I ever claimed to have one. But no matter what I did, Turbo Tax thought it knew better, and would not let me file electronically, nor delete the incorrect  page, nor override anything. I could not file online even though I had paid to do so. So the IRS and my state got stuck with two very thick paper returns."

456249,1.0,2018,"I have a rental house and take deductions so I've used this for the past decade. It takes my last year info and imports it. It could do some things better. For instance, just because I do not donate this tax year to a charity, it should not permanently delete that charity from my list and make me re-enter it a year or two later.
If you make a mistake and enter an amount into the wrong place, it later keeps that form and flags it as an error because there are 0s in some of the fields."

456270,-1.0,2018,Wrong year!
456291,-1.0,2018,"Premise of this software is great. However, the first year I had this all of the recipes I had hand typed into a ""cookbook"" that I created disappeared one day. Frustrating, but I figured ok - let's give this another go, it was an unfortunate mistake. Another year's worth of recipes and today it happened again. I updated the program, opened it up and saw that my recipes were intact.... until I added one new recipe. Then, all of the recipes are gone and the new one I added was not even there. A completely empty cookbook again. Found the file, tried restoring to a previous version - nothing. Whoever creates this program has no idea how to design software - avoid like the plague."
456292,1.0,2018,"Haven't gotten into the entire program yet but there is so much. For a recipe collector as I am, this is going to be wonderful to catalog my own as well as recipes I have scavenged from around the country."

456296,1.0,2018,"This version of MasterCook replaced an older version.  My only problem is that the images I use in the recipes disappear and are replaced by a 'Pictures on CD"" statement.  That is most aggravating when you have as many recipes as I do.  While customer service has tried to help, nothing has worked."
456297,1.0,2018,I love Mastercook
456298,1.0,2018,"I have been using this software for years and it is an essential part of my cooking.  Lots of great features; recipe storage, menu creation, and shopping list creation.  It is very easy to enter recipes because of a great autofill feature.  I especially find the shopping lists it creates as very helpful when planning a party."
456299,1.0,2018,"Although the interface isn't as appealing as it was back when MC was being produced by Sierra, it still has the same functionality and ease of use.  I've been using this product for more years than I can count and am happy I broke down and finally upgraded."

456328,-1.0,2018,"After you buy it, they could care less about you, avoid the software, no customer service, you have to dig forever just to make a support ticket, as they make it impossible to even do a reinstall on a clean format. Your password is completely useless, as they promptly state that you have exceeded the maximum number of installs, which is complete bs. They have absolutely no phone support, and the program deletes more than it should by far, causing a reinstall to fix it, if you're careless with it. The power settings default to leaving the screen on for just 5 minutes, so many issues, they seem to dislike or just not care about paying customers, and it shows."

456497,-1.0,2018,"Oh, brother!  I wish I had read reviews first too, instead of just trusting the Microsoft site.  Microsoft claims it has partnered with Laplink, since Windows Easy Transfer no longer exists in Windows 10.  I tried the migration using PCmover Pro SEVEN times, each time, migrating less data, no apps, etc.  Every time I moved the data to my new computer, all browsers lost their ability to connect to the internet, even though my computer showed that I had a connection to my secure router.  There must have been some setting transferring, that was messing things up.  I called Laplink tech support, shared my screen and was eventually told that the problem was probably because my computer is old (no kidding, that is why I bought a new computer!) and needed to be cleaned up before a migration.  I was put on hold, while a ""supervisor"" was contacted.  This guy then told me that my problem was beyond the software's provided tech support and I would need to enter into a service contract, in order to receive more assistance.  Nope.  I also tried Costco tech support, HP tech support and Windows tech support (hours of my time).  No one could tell me what setting could be affecting this, so I could just uncheck it before migrating.  HP tried to sell me a service contract too.

I used CCleaner on my computer myself, followed instructions that I found online, installed Windows Easy Transfer on my new computer, migrated my data (lost settings) only and it went smoothly.  All my browsers work.  So much for trying to save myself time.  I wasted a whole week of evenings, trying to make it easy on myself.  It would have been worth the cost of PCmover Pro, had it actually worked or had tech support been willing to help me without additional charges.

I IMed with Laplink today and asked for a refund.  I was told that I needed to send them logs, which I never was able to find on either machine, before they would process my refund.  After another 45 minutes of back and forth and being told that someone would review my refund request in 1-2 days, I finally advised that I would just dispute my credit card charges, as I was not interested in spending any more time on this.  Only then was I told that my refund would be processed today.

SO frustrating!"

I went through the download process three times with no success and then contacted the PC Mover Express chat line.

The only help this partner could offer was to try to charge me a service fee to help with the migration.  I am going to contact PC Mover Express and attempt to get a refund.  I guess I should have read all the negative reviews before I made this purchase.  BUYER BEWARE!"
456511,-1.0,2018,"I bought this product to move files from an old computer to a new one.  The new one had 1T of storage on the D drive.  The software did not recognize the D drive and informed me that I had insufficient space to move files.  I spent an hour waiting for tech support before giving up.  The next day, I spent over 2 hours with tech support.  They changed the direction of the software to the D drive.  Using an Ethernet connection between the computers, the software told me that the file transfer was complete--18 hours later.  I would have appreciated the wait, but the transfer failed to move music, picture or video files--the main reason I bought the software.  Awful experience."

456513,-1.0,2018,Couldn't get it to work.  Kept trying to move data to my SSD drive C instead of my main storage in D.  I made the adjustment in advanced settings but it kept going back to C.  I shut down the application on the new computer and when I went back to try again it wouldn't let me on again.  I tried calling tech support but was put on perpetual hold.

I finally selected the 'abort cloning and return to Windows' option... and my laptop rebooted right back to the cloning option... and rebooted to the cloning option. Unfortunately, with my system the software got into a do loop and would let me reboot back into Windows. Fortunately, on the NTI website FAQ section for Echo, there was some who experienced the same issue and they provided a way out (requires finding your recovery drive and booting into recovery mode to a command prompt).

One of the strongest parts of the Fluenz program are the tutorials.  I had a fairly rigorous background in high school French from 50 years ago, and as I went through levels 3, 4, and 5 of the French course what most impressed me is how rigorously the material has been pruned to the critical essentials of the language's structure that one needs to communicate.  It does not provide an exhaustive study of grammar, but then a rigorous knowledge of the subjunctive mode or the future conditional is not critical to everyday communication, which is what most of us would be seeking in on line language study.  What the program does provide is a sturdy scaffolding upon which to build communication skills with further exposure to more vocabulary and more nuanced grammatical structures.  I started trying to learn Portuguese with absolutely no exposure save my previous studies in another romance language with the French.  Since I am preparing for a trip to Portugal, I first started with Pimsleur as the only rigorous course I could find in European Portuguese, but I put that aside after a couple of weeks as I found its particular audio only format tedious to a degree that I was dreading each study session, even though the lessons were only 20 minutes apiece.  I next tried Rocket Portuguese as I had had reasonably good success with their Japanese program starting from a modest previous exposure, but as an absolute beginner in Portuguese I found myself struggling with the somewhat haphazard grammatical instruction, but even more so by being inundated by their massive vocabulary dumps.  I have found it to be much more effective in the early stages of learning a new language to try to develop a facility with the language's basic patterns and structures with a modest vocabulary rather than to try to learn endless lists of often miscellaneous words, which often amount to a brute memory exercise in trying to regurgitate a series of near random syllables.  Once one can begin to hear the structure of the spoken language or comprehend basic structures seen in writing, it becomes much easier to retain new vocabulary as it then comes in a context which provides an extra memory assist.  Once again the Fluenz program is consciously designed to provide a foundation upon which to build with further experience and study.  It is not, however, an easy ticket to instant fluency.  Particularly if one does not have the luxury of a total immersion experience, repetition and focus are still the most critical aspects in achieving  any level of proficiency in a new language.  Certainly the Fluenz program is one of the more expensive alternatives out there, but in my experience the extra money has been well spent."
456879,1.0,2018,"This is best language non free foreign learning program that I've used so far. In Ms. Gil promo she says that learning a language is hard and that it requires a lot of practice. Being an average person I know that is true . Ms. Gil promo is what really sold me on trying it. I also know that it takes a lot of practice and repetition to be even minimally conversant. Fluenz requires a lot of work and it is not boringly repetitive. I've used Duolingo, a great free language program to establish a base knowledge of Portuguese , fluenz has increased my base proficiency in a short time. Ms. Gil talks about rules of portuguese grammar. This has also helped my proficiency.

I think that you really need a long immersion experience (months-more than six, years) in an environment away whatever your native language is to become truly proficient. Unfortunately America doesn't provide most of us with  non English immersion. Ms. Gil promo didn't over promise and I think the lessons deliver. . I attend some language hours and the most proficient non native language speakers have been to a country where they have had an immersive experience. I've been attending these language hours for over eight years. I'm still waiting a truly proficient average person that has just used one of these language program.  Hopefully Fluenz never will  get sucked into promising miracles (Oh Lourdes! ) like their competitors. ."
456880,1.0,2018,"My wife and I are both learning Portuguese with Fluenz. We are both in level one; I have finished session 7 and she has finished session 10. We are starting to speak Portuguese to each other and can usually understand what the other is trying to say! (But not always)

The program and style of teaching works well for us as long as we work on it each day. If we just can't understand and apply a concept, we just repeat the class and workouts. If we have to be away from it for a while, as during the Christmas holidays, and find we can't quite remember correctly, it is so easy to go back and ""sit through the class"", practice with the workouts, and we are back up to speed again. The program also has flashcards for each lesson that allow you to practice pronunciation and/or spelling as fast or slow as you want.

Our support questions before and after purchase were quickly and accurately answered. Thanks, Andy!

Fluenz is working so well for us!"
456888,1.0,2018,love this product. As a small electrical company this is all I need for estimating. Still working on getting my prices in the template so can't wait for the new update. Highly recommend for small businesses
456897,-1.0,2018,product does not give enough info about product. I purchased this product only to find out that it will not work for my business and cant get a refund. that's 130.00 down the drain.
456915,-1.0,2018,Want a refund
456917,-1.0,2018,"All of the previous reviews are correct: I keep being asked for an 8 digit code that was not included. Amazon directed me to contact the manufacturer. Also, the Word docs print with a watermark that indicates you printed from this program. Waste of money!"

McAfee for me from now on."
456964,1.0,2018,"For what is offered in this ""plan,"" for lack of a better term, $62.00 is NOT a lot of money to spend for it. For years I used the free versoion of Avast and had fewer problems with security than I did paying for other versions. What I now use, is a considerable step up. Take a look at what they offer BEFORE you buy anything else. You may find yourself surprised at what Avast offers as opposed to anyone else."

456976,1.0,2018,"This is a good software package for the price.  Great diversity of options for layout, backgrounds, fonts, colors, etc.  3-D feature is also cool.  Not impressed with the graphics library, as the pics are cartoonish and too elementary.  However, most of my designs are purely original or use altered Web images, so this is not a problem.  Very happy that I can transfer my work to a PDF file and have my art printed.  Will take a while to learn all that it can do."
456977,1.0,2018,"Serif is great for word processing for the most part. I don't like that it auto capitalizes the first letter of each line and you have to go in and change it.

457019,1.0,2018,I have used all of the majors and Avast is by far the best I've used. The interface is easy to navigate with no hidden features that you have to hunt down to make any changes that you want. The definitions stay current automatically and after around 10 years of use I have yet to have any unwanted intrusions. The only negative would be too many separate costs. They should offer a bundle of all services to be utilized for either home or business use instead of having to buy features separately.
457020,0.0,2018,"The product works as promised, but I didn't like all the extra features that needed to be purchased separately.  I assumed I would get all the extras within the Premier Package, but I was mistaken.  Next time I will read the product details carefully."

After than, you earn points to play games.  Again, nothing very exciting, but good for young children as well as learning mouse and key controls (the games use the arrow keys).  Also, it can be downloaded and played off line, which is good if you don't want your kids to stumble into any popups while they are playing or if your internet service is spotty."

But, not having the ability to check if my keystrokes were encrypted, I checked online tech journals. There I found that it was verified by tests to operate as advertised.

457534,1.0,2018,"I've struggled to find backup software that would let me do what I want to do:
1. Create ""Projects"" by selecting folders and/or files.
2. Set a schedule.
3. Copy the files that have changed to my destination drive.

As simple as it sounds, this is not something easy to find.

Of course, GS RichCopy will do a lot more than that but most software products simply won't allow this amount of control for the user.

And get this... Email support is really timely! I was moving the software to a new computer today and ran into registration problems. Tech support responded to me EIGHT TIMES within the course of about 4-5 hours. They were relentless in finding a solution. (BTW, I created the problem myself.)"
457536,1.0,2018,"I have been in this industry since 1970 and was a developer for several decades.  This is the best backup software package and their documentation manual is excellent .  A representative may have to remote into your computer to show you how to get things setup.  This representative will be one of the programmers that developed the software.  This is important because this person has thorough knowledge of the product and can easily customize it for your particular needs.  I like the fact that the system is not generating encrypted compressed backup files.  This allows you to view the folders and files to ensure you are getting everything backed up that you want backed up.  I have my system setup so files can be retrieved and restored up to one year.  Should you want encrypted compressed files then they can show you how this can be accommodated.

I purchased this product to replacing the backup function of Norton Backup with Security.  I had a computer crash.  Levels 1, 2 and 3 of Norton support representatives were unable to restore the encrypted compressed files from my backup server.  I eventually corrected the issue without any help from Norton professionals.  The Norton reps were of absolutely no help at all.  I found them to be very poorly trained.  I have sent Michael Hargis, Nortons Senior Vice President Support, a scathing letter regarding their inadequate backup software and support.

The GS RichCopy 360 backup system is like a breath of fresh air.  It was developed by GuruSquad.  You will find the Guru Squad support rep to be high quality and the best.  The software is also the best."

First off this program is only for pictures shot in B+W. Another thing  is this program has no documentation whatsoever. Next, this program only accepts JPG files. I tried importing RAW files but it doesn't recognize them. So, if you want to edit B+W photos make sure you are also shooting in JPG as well as RAW (if your camera allows this). I must admit I thought this program would accept any kind of picture ( RAW ) but alas it does not and nothing was mentioned in the product description to make me think otherwise. I did however have some B+W JPG's in my library and imported them. Basically the program is nothing more than a bunch a presets that you can tweak here and there. I have briefly looked at them and they seem decent which is why I am giving this a 3 star rating. If you import color pics and try using the presets they turn out looking blown out and and badly edited. Honestly, if you have any of the Adobe suite (Ps or Lr) save your money unless you want some quick effects to touch up you B+W pics to share quickly."

We couldn't find a free video make we were happy with until we came across Movavi. It allowed me to download it for free and didn't say anything about paying to be able to save it on a usb or cd. I downloaded it, put the entire slideshow together (several hours of work) and when I went to save it to a usb, it told me I had to buy the entire program ($60+) in order to save it without the giant Movavi banner literally across the middle of the slideshow. Because we were in the middle of a tough time for our family and didn't want to deal with finding a new program and re-making the whole slideshow my parents bit the bullet and bought the program, which we will never use again. I will definitely not be recommending this program to anyone as it is completely misleading and a waste of time and money."

457971,1.0,2018,"All of the comments from December 2017 and early 2018 are written in the same style and appear to be from a person (or persons) deliberately trying to trash this software. Notice that none of these mostly 1-star reviews give any reasons for not liking the product.  They do not offer any alternative recommendations. (Also notice the many previous 5-star reviews.)

I have used most of the major antivirus suites on the market on my five home computers, and ESET Smart Security is my current favorite. It always scores highly on detection, is easy to configure and use, and the included 2-way firewall gives an extra level of protection. It also has a very low false-positive rate, which prevents the kind of errors that can lock up your computer or even stop it from booting up.

Having had my own computer business for many years, I get numerous requests for support from friends and family. I recently downloaded this free trial to install on a friend's laptop (who is a total novice with computers) to see if he liked it. He did and now has the paid retail version.

There are a number of other excellent antivirus suites on the market. The major differences between them are ease of use and personal preference. Amazon makes ESET easy to try with this download. If you have more than one computer, check the web for deals on multi-packs  as you can save a lot this way, and the license doesn't start until you install it on the first system. If you do decide to switch brands, be sure to completely remove the installed program before installing another. Only one antivirus should be installed on your system. Go to the manufacturer's web site for instructions."

It has organizer capabilities which I do not use, but the calendar functions are great, and I post the printed result on my fridge every month.  Very easy to add a one time event or a recurring event, and can be shown with or without a time.  I'm hoping the program updates will add the number of years to the subject line for birthdays and anniversaries, so it will calculate and show ""Bob's 35th Birthday"".  Many holidays are pre-programmed in to display each month, but they are not user deletable, so you are left with dates like ""Arbor Day"" or ""Teacher's Day"" which you may not be interested in.  One handy item is you can scroll back to previous months and see the events that you had typed in."

I contacted Corel, and they told me it had never been activated, and that the error message I was getting on my computer was telling me I had another version of Corel on my computer that I needed to uninstall. Except I don't have any version of Corel on my computer - I've not used a Corel program in at least 15 years and that was on a work computer at a job long ago.

I chatted with Corel, I emailed with Corel, repeatedly - they never gave me any solution or options at all. They'd pass me off or escalate the issue, and then they'd repeat the same things I was told in the previous rounds.

The programming isn't as well thought out as it should be for the cost. Trying to import a photo of a yard to design over it, will import one thousand little mini photos, and that's just stupid. Also, the scaling is silly. In order to render a concept so that you can actually see the plants, you have to have dozens more plants in a fill, instead of just the one plant. If the client can't see it, why would they pay for it? If the client see's hundreds of plants, they are going to freak out.

If you pay out ov two different accounts you will not get a list of all the ""credit card payments"" only the ones in the account you happen to be in.  It may be the simpler version does not offer this feature.  And each template will only hold 7 accounts and the entries per account are limited as well.  I assumed that as in a Excel spreedsheet you would have unlimited entries for each account.  Many of the Excel features are limited/locked as well so if you intent to augment your entries with stuff from Excel it may take some work/creativity.  As a Quicken user I find this template very limited in its functionality.

Expensive , support on line is a waste of time , and if you make the very serious mistake of actually following their advice you may brick your system as some help advises you to use resedit  which edits the windows register, a very advances and last resort type of thing to do and then only if you are an expert.  the FAQs fall into the above category.  terrible grammar, the English is so bad you can't even interpret it properly.  The update process tries to be seamless but it isn't.  And then there are the quirks.  Yes, quirks and there are many of them.  One bad one is when the program starts you may get a ""error no disk in drive"" from windows.  It almost made me uninstall the program until I figured out that hitting any of the buttons on the dialogue box (10-20) times would clear the error and it would go to the next step where the error would appear again.  Hitting any of the DB buttons( over an over)  will get you to a normal state where you can watch your BR disc.

After updating my software with a patch from the CyberLink website this month, I find now ALL of my Blu-Ray discs, regardless of age will not play in my PC.

I'm now required to purchase a new version of the software, but what's to say this won't cease to work shortly thereafter and thus require a third version to be purchased.  My Blu-Ray collection has now become a rental library where I'm virtually subscribing to watch what I've already bought."

458565,-1.0,2018,"I have been hunting for good 3D-face-animation software for my real-world projects.

I tried a much less well-known solution before landing on CrazyTalk. I tried the 15-day Free-trial version of CrazyTalk 8 downloaded directly from Reallusion site.

Unfortunately, my searches should have been stopped in the other less-known solution, simply because it can produce much better 3D-face-animation, and cost much less time and need much less learning effort than CrazyTalk 8.

Strictly speaking, CrazyTalk is NOT a full-fledged 3D-face-animation software package, since it is not able to create one of the basic elements of full-fledged 3D-face-animation software - realistic 3d-facial-expressions, no matter how hard you try.

If you want an objective definition, CrazyTalk is a speech-driven facial animation package that can only delivers  caricature-based animation.

I guess it is against the Amazon policy to explicitly give the name of the other software vendor. It also seems I cant get the above review published on the Reallusion site.

Thus I suggest you do some good searches in Google, and try a few solutions.

Good luck!"

Which means your balances are off until they fix the issue. This happens weekly if not several times a week. They may fix the issue once but they don't fix the programming problem. The reconciliation process doesnt make sense.. if you reconcile an account through June 1st why would the program populate with a date prior to that the next time you go to reconcile? Typically you cant go backwards with overlapping dates when you reconcile. Next concern...I get the error on syncing my bank accounts often so I will enter the transactions manually so that I can pay bills.

458722,1.0,2018,"I have used Math Without Borders Resources for Algebra I, Geometry and Algebra II Honors Courses, for a homeschool curriculum using Foerster's Algebra I and II and Chakerian Geometry, a the  honors level.  The Math Without Borders resources allowed us to study these subjects at home, with a depth and thoroughness which would not have been possible without external tutors/classes.  The videos very clearly explain the material in connection with each section of the textbooks, which allow for a very well organized and sequential study of the subjects.  The videos and resources also present the solutions to many of the problems related to each section.  We found that encouraging our students to solve the problems first, without help, and then watching the videos created the most effective learning approach.  The subjects are studied from a theoretical perspective, and then they are used in very practical applications which led our students to several ""aha!"" moments in understanding mathematics.  For students wishing greater challenges, the materials offer many opportunities to explore more difficult problems and applications.  I found the Math Without Borders resources to be one of them most helpful tools in learning mathematics at home."

First it was very difficult to reach their customer service department and then to be informed that there was NO telephone support procedure. Instead, they claim to offer support via email. I completed an email request for help and received a reply 8 hours later requesting more information as to my problem. After I explained my problem, I never heard from Corel again. A terrible way to support a customer. I like Word Perfect but I am very unhappy with the corporate decision of Corel to abandon a customer."
458748,1.0,2018,"Unfortunately the DVD disc received had a critical file missing, Corel sent me a download with the critical file inserted.  For some reason there has  been ongoing problems with the word-processing package on Corel Office 8, necessitating many contacts with one of the Corel Technicians.

I have been successful, via using another part of the programme, to be able opening the word-perfect, word-processing programme, which was the major reason for changing to Corel WordPerfect.

As most people would be aware you can no longer purchase Microsoft Office you have to rent the programme, there is little assistance with eliminating errors in Microsoft Office Outlook programme that has regularly ceased to open, also the problem wipes you Addresses.  One one occasion Microsoft technicians had control of my computer whilst they tried to remedy the problem.  A fortnight later the programme again crashed deleting all my contacts.  Fortunately I had copied my contacts to an Excel

I am very pleased with the assistance of Corel technicians trying to solve the problem, the other programmes within Corel Office all work without a problem, since I used the download provided by Corel.  I cannot fault the endeavours of the Corel technicians who are trying to solve this minor problem.  I have no doubt that the people assisting me, will continue to assist, and they will be successful.

Even with this problem I will rate Corel Office 8 ahead of Microsoft Office."

The first one is that when I converted documents with tables to (.doc), the lines between columns are erased.
The second one is that when I converted documents with tables to (.docx), the lines between columns were not erased but the text was justified to the right and stays like that even if you justify the text back to the left and save the documents.

You can use the license on more than one computer, I think 3 is their max

Cons
It's very fickle! Some days it works great and other days it keeps dropping the video. Meaning it starts to open up and then the program closes. Sometimes I have to keep reopening the program because it keeps closing, Fickle!"

458990,1.0,2018,"I downloaded the trial-version of Clip Studio Paint EX from the CELSYS website (they're the publisher of this software) and installed it for my 12yo daughter to see if she would like it. After working with it for 30-days, she's become quite proficient with the program. So I decided to buy the program for her.

If purchased directly from the CELSYS website, the EX version will set you back $219 (at the time of this review). But according to Wiki, ""The Windows and macOS versions of the software are sold with perpetual licenses, either downloaded or on physical media."" So I decided to try this legacy ""Hybrid Retail"" version on DVD from Amazon (which was produced back when SmithMicro was the US distributor for CELSYS).

Inside the DVD keepcase is a printed label with the software's serial number. I opened the trial software on my daughter's PC, typed in the serial number, and initiated the online license verification. And it worked, saving me $130! If you're interested in using this program, then I highly recommend buying it here while Amazon still has these legacy SmithMicro DVDs in stock."

459008,1.0,2018,"I loved the Manga EX4 version of the software which I used at my last job. I wanted to get my own copy of the software which is now called Clip Studio ... and I got the PRO version instead of EX as I didn't really every use the Line Trace feature.

It's an awesome piece of software but unfortunately I could not get either of my two tablets (WACOM intuous and a Mono Price  tablet) to work with full pressure mode on a Windows 10 PC. All I get is a thick line or nothing.  They both worked when the software was installed on a Windows 7 PC and on a mac. (I got the license for myself and can use only one at a time so don't sue me for a 49 dollar package please).

Many trials and tribulations later - I am still stuck on a non-pressure responsive software.
None of these worked on windows 10:
1. Tried the WinTablet check box on/off feature
2. Tried turn off check (and toggle check on/off) on the Z parameter for tablets on the software
3. Uninstalled the tablet driver that came with the CD and reinstalled from scratch
4. The last ditch effort with a native driver from windows 10
5. Tried checking the pressure curve on a custom brush with no results.

It's my issue with a windows machine. The software on a mac worked as expected. Very powerful. Awesome for sketching in b/w. I love it.

My favorite features are the ink brushes, the custom images and the ability to u/v map distorted images into different shapes. There are so many options to get just the right shade, scale and depth it's awesome to work.

This is not a replacement for Photoshop if you want to edit photos. This software is for drawing out your own comics, cartoons and sketches. The filters are awesome ... and with the pattern brushes you can create some really comic(s) backgrounds, etc.

Oh yeah! - My friend has the EX version working almost flawlessly on a 2 year old Microsoft surface tablet. (I have the PRO version - I don't think it matters for a tablet sensitivity if the versions are different.)  He gets the tapering pressure at the start of a stroke but not the end of a stroke.  I just get a uniformly thick brush for the length of the stroke on my HP laptop.

Thus the one star downgrade.

Conclusion: This is an AWESOME software package for drawing, not photo editing or collages like Photoshop; I just wish it was easier to work with generic or WACOM drawing tablets.

PS
If someone can help with the driver installation on windows I would appreciate it."
459009,-1.0,2018,I have had to call the shipper twice due to failing of the product key. Now Microsoft is not able to recognize it again. I need a program that actually works all of the time!!!
459010,-1.0,2018,"Way overpriced (you can get Professional via download for $30/computer).  Unfortunately I bought this first, and even though it was shrink-wrapped Microsoft says that all 3 seats are already taken.  It said you have to go through Register By Phone.  But when you get to that screen, it say that option is no longer supported for that software.  Then it crapped out.  Going through Repair for 10 minutes just to get to the point of starting over.

Rebooted after Repair, now completely screwed.  It won't even start; says I have to go through Repair again.  Now have to completely uninstall and reinstall.  Downgraded from overpriced to total waste.

I don't know if this company is legit or not but the software prompted me to do a rollback recovery.  Guess who has to call Microsoft to work through a recovery failure....  Thanks Stellar...."
459055,1.0,2018,"Pros:
-Mostly reliable transcription 95% +
-Fast transcription
-real time. No more waiting for human turnaround.
-programmable macros - very useful especially with EPIC
-included mic is nice and buttons are programmable for repetitive tasks.
-Works (or more accurately, is not deliberately sabotaged) with most EMR. Lower levels of Dragon will not work with EMR because Nuance is committed to revenue through product stratification and at risk for eventual ossification.
-Has specialty-specific (kinda) medical lexicon that exceeds google voice transcription.  Google transcription (through Google Docs) does a better job of Proper Nouns base don increased contextual cues and the neural network that is associational relationships.

Cons
-Real time. You have to stop and correct errors and can't babble off a note as fast as if you didn't see corrections in real time.
-User Interface too technical for end users. I have been using DNS for greater than 10 years. It is a legacy UI that is needlessly complex. The software takes up too much resources for its results. As such, it supports whole support companies, installers and local gurus in hospital systems. It seems their business plan is at odds with creating the best transcription software possible.
-Annoyance of having to pick different lexicon models for different tasks, email vs. EMR transcription for instance.
-Persistent critical mistranscription of (he/she), (an/and/at), prosthetist, extremities despite multiple trainings. You'd be surprised how many people get annoyed at being mislabeled by gender.
-Weird waking up behavior after mic has been asleep awhile. Often screws up the first word and gets better. but that means (uugh) more corrections and less time outside of work.
-Incompatibility with citrix timing resulting in dropped words and letters (Needs character rate entry modified in config file) when logging into EMR remotely.
- Power Mic is limited to only work with this version of Dragon despite technical feasibility to work with any other lesser version.  Don't get me wrong. Mic works great but I hate being pushed into a corner with unlocked features that were created not as a true technological limitation but by business strategy. Their quasi-hostile business practices might kill them.
-takes too long to load. No, seriously.

I'm a native English Speaker with a Mid-Atlantic accent.
Bottom Line: Best dictation software package...for now for local installation. It will save time over typing. Could use better contextual interpretation."

459109,1.0,2018,"We have been using VideoPsalm at our church for the past month. Before that we used PowerPoint.

I am very glad I discovered this software.  It makes displaying songs and bible verses extremely easy.  Putting together the presentation for each service is also much easier than I experienced with PowerPoint.

Cool features include:

1) Being able to show any song at a moments notice
2) Being able to show any bible verse at a moments notice
3) Being able to correct/fix slides during a live presentation without affecting what's on the screen/projector
4) Agenda files (the actual presentation you save) are fully portable.  You can work on it at home and know that it will look exactly the same when you load it on the church computer
5) VideoPsalm doesn't care what resolution you are projecting to.  I can create the presentation with a different resolution than the church projector and know it will still look exactly how I want.

I've also asked the creators of VideoPsalm many questions through Facebook messenger and they are quick to respond and very helpful.

There is a bit of a learning curve to this program.  I played around with it for almost a month before I felt comfortable giving it a trial run in a live service.  Once you get the hang of how the program works it becomes extremely easy and satisfying to use."

This software seems to depend on you watching videos on their website...I neither have the time nor patience to watch videos when I can just quickly read something.  Anyway, working with the software wasn't too bad.  It is fairly intuitive and can be understood with some work.  You have access to a wide variety of templates, galleries and etc...  Most of them were so generic and bland that I couldn't imagine anyone using them.  Moving items around is a bit annoying as it seems to be geared more towards touchscreens.  But maybe I am wrong on that because I didn't watch the particular video dealing with that...and I probably never will...  Anyway, for the price this is a fairly good piece of software with a lot of features."

On top of that, if you view the source code you will notice that it is littered with <div>'s, the classes/id's are completely unorganized, functions that should be in separate files are not, etc. Case in point, it is an extremely cluttered and non-optimized generator."

However, if you have others on your network and thus can't control every factor, this is the one I would choose above all others, especially since it's not annoying."
459229,1.0,2018,It's a good product. It ranks highly on AV comparatives. Which is why I went with it. I only knock it down a peg because it is too aggressive. I've had many false positives when trying to install software I frequently use. It doesn't have a quick and easy way to override the false positive either.  I have to remove it from quarantine then add it to the exceptions list.  If I remove an item from quarantine. The software should ask if I want to make an exception.

459390,0.0,2018,"Corel removed a superb feature that had existed in Pinnacle Studio. In Pinnacle 9 and 10, for instance, the video and audio tracks could be locked independently. This feature was the strongest reason to buy Pinnacle Studio and not to buy the competing Corel products. Using this feature, the user could lock the audio, make extensive cuts in the video, replacing it with other video or stills without cutting or disturbing the audio. Equally, the user could lock the video, erase the audio, and replace it with a superior audio stream. This was very important when recording a presentation. Users could provide a separate microphone to record the speaker and be free from the echo chamber or typical noises from crowds. Or, the user could pass a microphone to questioners to record their questions or comments. Then, the user could lock the video, cut the appropriate section of the audio and substitute the alternate audio stream,making a professional sounding audio.
Similarly, in the older Pinnacle products, adding text overlays was easy, We had a great choice of texts, colors, bevels, etc. It was easy to scroll text from below the lower edge and have it disappear above the upper edge. With the Corel 20/21 products, creating 'Titles' as they are now known, is difficult. Although there is a bewildering array of text effects, the products can NOT scroll text from below the screen then through the screen beyond the upper frame.
In the older Pinnacle, adding transitions was simple and straightforward. The user selected the transition and interposed it between the frames. The user could establish standard times for the transition, but adjust them as needed. In the present Corel 20/21 products, adding transitions is difficult. They have created a bewildering number of transitions, almost none of which would be used by professionals. It is extremely difficult to sort through them all to find the 'fade' transition and the 'dissolve' transition is missing. Instead, they have created a gimmick, in which the user 'folds down' the corner of the frame to create a dissolve. It doesn't work, and the duration of the transition can't be controlled. The user also has a 'right mouse option for transition in and transition out. However the only option is the dissolve.
Finally, it's impossible to produce a simple mp4 video. Using the export feature, the user has a wide variety of options. One of these is to name to output movie. It doesn't work. Most of the time, the use obtains a movie with a long string of numbers as the name. If the movie is renamed, the resulting movie can't be moved to a different location, i suspect that the file does not close properly, because when I try to move a movie, the system responds that the movie to too large to fit.
Corel's support is adequate. Support tickets are answered promptly, and generally with accurate information. Operational questions go ot a 'chat' function, which is fine if you live in the Far East. However, they have no support for the American time zones. You would think that a support function would have people prepared to work in the American time zones, but they don't
This the the story of the Corel versions of Studio 20/21. They've taken simple procedures, made them ludicrously difficult, added a plethora of choices while hiding the simple ones used almost all the time, all to produce a movie that may or may not be properly named or may or may not be moved. It's a so-so product that should look back to its past and restore those things that made Pinnacle great enough that Corel bought them.."
459391,-1.0,2018,"This is literally the worst piece of software that I've ever used! I thought Sony Movie Studio was backwards and hard to use, but Pinacle is a buggy piece of crap! When ever I try starting it up, I have to restart my computer if it hasn't been shutdown since I last tried to use Pinacle. And this could be just a quick ""I forgot to add something before I upload"". Nope have to restart the computer before it'll even recognize the program. When I ""export"" because it's not called rendering, the file doesn't always keep the name I give it. Usually it gets some barcode the program generated for my file and I have to make sure I'm uploading the right video to YouTube. Usually they're in something that resembles sequential order, but I have in a few occasions almost re-uploaded the same video, only to have YouTube tell me the file was already up. And finally, it slows my computer's down like a mother! It's crashed my laptop just trying to import a video file a few times, which led to me having to restart the laptop to get Pinacle out of it's corner. And it makes my gaming PC run like crap! Don't waste your time with this and either go with something from Sony or put up with Windows Moviemaker. This isn't worth your money."
459392,1.0,2018,I like this software's user interface to edit and merge segments to produce my videos.  Processing speed for blue-ray quality videos is slow and it does not use graphics card processing capabilities.  But I can let it run all night if it has to.  Due to a software bug I have to specify the 60i HD output setting for Blu-ray disc creations versus standard 24p - but this is good for high action scenes.
459393,0.0,2018,After using Pinnacle 12 successfully I have found 20 very hard. The changed methods require a very advanced knowledge of the theory behind videos. There is a need for a version for the amateur to do basic editing. There is the tendency to look elsewhere for another supplier of editing.

459398,1.0,2018,"Easy to use. Quality Output, both video & audio.  Supports so many formats.  Has been supported for years.  Recently purchased by Corel.  Lots of YouTube tutorials."
459399,0.0,2018,Most features pretty good. User interface not terribly intuitive.  Pop-up hints kind of sparse.  Pretty much lacking hot keys and default keys.  Everything action has to be a mouse click.
459400,1.0,2018,The software is written for 64bit capability and takes advantage of my system. It does freeze up once in a great while but that has not stopped me from using the software extensively.
459407,1.0,2018,PRO : Likde that it was fairly simple to learn in a short time.  CON : Not nearly enough music to incorporate into video.
459408,-1.0,2018,we reached 2018 and still not supporting Arabic Language
459409,1.0,2018,"Here's to hoping it doesn't get corrupted before I edit 5 videos.  In their defense I was using fossil elite book and am slow at making videos...  (maybe less than 10 in last yr).
Very good for more complex editing needs, without having to pay monthly for subscription.  Good support on YouTube if you want to know how to use it.  Would recommend for video editors or other Graphics people who aren't new to a certain form of Graphics.  Good luck.  =]"
459410,1.0,2018,Excelent. Easy to use. Professional.
459412,1.0,2018,"Excellent product, good training tutorials, easy to use.  A complete video authoring tool."
459413,1.0,2018,"Very great movie editor. If you're looking to put together a well made video, this won't disappoint. The only thing it lacks are diverse transitions."
459414,1.0,2018,Even a novice can use this! I've already produced 2 videos and on my third. GREAT App.
459416,-1.0,2018,"It has many cool features, and to some extent user friendly and easy to use, but it freezes and constantly crashes, although I was using a powerful desktop (Windows 10, Intel i7 processor, 16GB RAM and multiples big internal disks). To burn to Blu-ray you have to purchase the feature separately!! which I did, but had so many issues as it keep failing after it start burning to the disk after long hours of process and the error it generate is not helpful at all and no useful information available, and it also many times fails to burn regular DVD.
I had difficulty to transfer the Blu-ray license to my laptop although I have the same product/product key!!
It doesn't support right-to-left text, which was supported by previous versions!!!
It takes very long to render HD footage.
It is okay for beginners, but will disappoint you if you are a pro.
It discouraged me to continue using it."
459424,1.0,2018,Is very nice but it was much smaller than I expected.
459425,1.0,2018,"It is just the right size, not large and showy. Love it."
459426,1.0,2018,Smaller than expected actually very tiny and short but pretty. Not sure if the opal is real honestly doesn't look like it but nonetheless pretty.
459427,-1.0,2018,The images are deceptive. The pendant is so small you can barely tell what it is. The quality in the pictures is not the quality of product you receive.
459432,-1.0,2018,it's a joke
459434,1.0,2018,good value
